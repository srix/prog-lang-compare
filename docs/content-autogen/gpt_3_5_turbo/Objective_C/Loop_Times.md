In Objective-C, you can use the `*` operator to perform multiplication between two numbers. Here are some examples:

```objc
int x = 5 * 2; // x is now 10
float y = 3.5 * 2; // y is now 7.0
double z = 1.5 * 3.5; // z is now 5.25
```

You can also use the `+=` operator to add a number to a variable multiple times. Here's an example:

```objc
int count = 0;
count += 1; // count is now 1
count += 2; // count is now 3
count += 3; // count is now 6
```

You can use the `for` loop to perform a set of instructions multiple times. Here's an example:

```objc
for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    NSLog(@"%d", i);
}
```

In this example, the loop will run 10 times, with `i` ranging from 0 to 9. Each time the loop runs, the value of `i` is printed to the console. You can use the `*` operator and variables to perform calculations inside the loop.
