Certainly! In Objective-C, you can convert an integer value to a string using the `NSString` class method `stringWithFormat:`. Here's an example:

```objective-c
int num = 42;
NSString *stringNum = [NSString stringWithFormat:@"%d", num];
NSLog(@"%@", stringNum); // Output: 42
```

In this example, we first declare the integer variable `num` and set its value to `42`. Then, we use the `stringWithFormat:` method to convert `num` to a string. The format specifier `%d` tells `stringWithFormat:` that we want to insert an integer value in the resulting string. Finally, we log the resulting string to the console using `NSLog()`.

You can also use other format specifiers to format the integer value differently in the resulting string. Here's an example:

```objective-c
int num = 42;
NSString *stringNum = [NSString stringWithFormat:@"The answer is %03d", num];
NSLog(@"%@", stringNum); // Output: The answer is 042
```

In this example, we use the format specifier `%03d`, which pads the integer value with zeroes to a width of 3 characters. This results in the string "042" instead of "42". We also include the string "The answer is " before the formatted integer in the resulting string.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.
