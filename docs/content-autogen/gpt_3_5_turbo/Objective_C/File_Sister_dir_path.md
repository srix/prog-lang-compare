In Objective-C, we can get the path of the sibling directory by manipulating the returned path from `NSFileManager`'s `URLsForDirectory:inDomains:` method. Here's an example code snippet to get the sister directory path:

```objective-c
NSFileManager *fileManager = [NSFileManager defaultManager];
NSURL *documentsDirectory = [[fileManager URLsForDirectory:NSDocumentDirectory inDomains:NSUserDomainMask] lastObject];
NSURL *sisterDirectory = [documentsDirectory URLByDeletingLastPathComponent];

// Example of getting the path of a directory named "SisterDirectory"
NSURL *sisterDirectoryWithName = [sisterDirectory URLByAppendingPathComponent:@"SisterDirectory"];
NSString *sisterDirectoryPath = sisterDirectoryWithName.path;
```

In the above code:

- We first retrieve the URL of the app's documents directory using `URLsForDirectory:inDomains:` method.
- Then, we retrieve the URL for the parent directory of the documents directory using the `URLByDeletingLastPathComponent` method.
- Finally, we create the URL for the sibling directory by appending the name of the sibling directory to the parent directory's URL and get the path of that URL using the `path` property.

You can replace "SisterDirectory" in the code snippet with the actual name of your desired sibling directory.
