Block binding in Objective-C is a technique that allows you to declare and define an anonymous function (block) within your code and assign it to a variable. This allows you to pass the block around as an argument to other functions and use it as a callback. 

Here's an example of how to use block binding in Objective-C:

```objective-c
// Declare a block
int (^addBlock)(int, int);

// Define the block
addBlock = ^(int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
};

// Call the block
int sum = addBlock(2, 3);

NSLog(@"The sum is %d", sum); // Output: The sum is 5
```

In the example above, we declare a block called `addBlock` that takes two `int` arguments and returns an `int`. We then define the block using the block syntax `^(int a, int b) { ... }` and assign it to the variable `addBlock`. Finally, we call the block with the arguments `2` and `3` and assign the result to the variable `sum`. The output of the `NSLog` statement is `The sum is 5`.

Here's another example that demonstrates passing a block as an argument:

```objective-c
// Define a function that takes a block as an argument
void printResult(int (^operation)(int, int), int a, int b) {
    int result = operation(a, b);
    NSLog(@"The result is %d", result);
}

// Call the function with a block
printResult(^(int a, int b) {
    return a * b;
}, 4, 5);

// Output: The result is 20
```

In this example, we define a function called `printResult` that takes a block as its first argument. The block takes two `int` arguments and returns an `int`. Inside the function, we call the block with the arguments `a` and `b`, and assign the result to the variable `result`. We then log the result using `NSLog`.

Finally, we call the `printResult` function with a block that multiplies its two arguments, `4` and `5`, using the block syntax `^(int a, int b) { return a * b; }`. The output of the `NSLog` statement is `The result is 20`.
