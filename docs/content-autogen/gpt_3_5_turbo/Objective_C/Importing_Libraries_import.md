To import a library in Objective-C, you use the `#import` directive. You can import both Apple frameworks and third-party libraries. Here are some examples:

```
#import <Foundation/Foundation.h> // Importing the Foundation framework
```

```
#import "MyCustomLib.h" // Importing a custom library called MyCustomLib
```

```
#import <AFNetworking/AFNetworking.h> // Importing a third-party library called AFNetworking
```

When you import a library, you can then make use of its classes, functions, and other components within your Objective-C code.
