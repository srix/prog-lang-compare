To assign values to variables in PHP, you use the assignment operator `=`. The syntax for assigning a value to a variable is:

```
$variable_name = value;
```

Here's an example:

```
$name = "John";
```

This assigns the string value "John" to the variable `$name`.

You can assign different types of values to variables in PHP, including:

- Strings: `"apple"`, `"John"`, `"Hello world"`
- Numbers: `10`, `3.14`, `-5`
- Booleans: `true` or `false`

You can also assign the result of an expression or function call to a variable. Here are some examples:

```
$sum = 1 + 2; // assigns the value 3 to $sum
$length = strlen("Hello"); // assigns the value 5 to $length
$is_admin = ($username == "admin"); // assigns true or false to $is_admin, depending on the value of $username
```

Note that in PHP, variables must start with the `$` symbol.
