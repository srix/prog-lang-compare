In PHP, there are two ways to add comments.

Single-line comments: Use double forward slashes (//) to add a single-line comment.

Example:
```
// This is a single-line comment in PHP
```

Multi-line comments: Use forward slash and an asterisk (/*) to start the comment and an asterisk and a forward slash (*/) to end the comment. This type of comment can span multiple lines.

Example:
```
/*
This is a 
multi-line 
comment in PHP
*/
```

Comments are used to add notes and explanations to your code, which can help you and other developers understand and maintain the code. Itâ€™s a best practice to add comments to your code to make it more readable and understandable.
