Block passing is a technique in PHP that involves passing a block of code as an argument to a function or method. This allows for greater flexibility and control over the execution of the code.

Here is an example of how block passing can be used:

```
function perform_with_retry($block, $max_attempts = 3)
{
    for ($i = 0; $i < $max_attempts; $i++) {
        try {
            return $block();
        } catch (Exception $e) {
            // log or handle the exception
        }
    }
    throw new Exception('Max attempts reached');
}

$result = perform_with_retry(function () {
    // perform some operation that may fail
    return something();
});
```

In this example, we define a function `perform_with_retry` that accepts two arguments: a block of code to execute and a maximum number of attempts to make. The function then attempts to execute the block of code up to the maximum number of attempts, catching any exceptions that may be thrown. If the block of code is successfully executed, the result is returned. Otherwise, if the maximum number of attempts has been reached, an exception is thrown.

The `perform_with_retry` function is called using block passing syntax, where a closure including the code to be executed is passed as an argument. This allows for dynamic execution of code and gives the programmer greater control over error handling and retries.

Overall, block passing is a powerful technique that can be used in PHP to achieve greater flexibility and control over the execution of code.
