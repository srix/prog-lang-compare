In PHP, a closure is an anonymous function that can be assigned to a variable or passed as an argument to another function. It can use variables that are in its parent scope, even after the parent function has finished execution. This allows for powerful applications such as creating and returning functions from other functions, as well as creating reusable code blocks for specific use cases.

Here is an example of a closure in PHP:

```
// Create a closure that uses a variable from outside its scope
$name = "John";
$greeting = function() use ($name) {
    echo "Hello, $name!";
};

// Call the closure
$greeting();
```

In this example, we create a closure that uses a variable `$name` from outside its scope. The `use` keyword allows the closure to access the variable. We then assign the closure to the variable `$greeting` and call it. The output will be `Hello, John!`.

We can also use closures with arrays and `array_map()` to manipulate the elements of an array:

```
// Square each number in an array using a closure
$numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
$squares = array_map(function($number) {
    return $number * $number;
}, $numbers);

// Output the squared numbers
foreach($squares as $square) {
    echo $square . " ";
}
```

In this example, we use the `array_map()` function to square each element in the `$numbers` array. The closure takes a single parameter `$number` and returns its squared value. The resulting `$squares` array contains the squared values of the original array. We then output the squared numbers using a `foreach` loop. The output will be `1 4 9 16 25`. 

In summary, closures in PHP allow for greater flexibility and efficiency in programming by allowing the creation of anonymous functions that can access variables from their parent scope. This makes it possible to write reusable code blocks and implement functional programming concepts in PHP.
