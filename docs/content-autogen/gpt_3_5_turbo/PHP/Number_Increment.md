To increment a number in PHP, you can use the `++` operator. 

Here's an example code snippet:

```
$num = 5;
$num++;

echo $num; // outputs 6
```

In this example, the variable `$num` is initially assigned a value of 5. The `++` operator is then used to increment the value of `$num` by 1. The resulting value of `$num` is 6, which is then output using the `echo` statement.

You can also use the `+=` operator to increment a number by a specific value. Here's an example:

```
$num = 5;
$num += 3;

echo $num; // outputs 8
```

In this example, the `+=` operator is used to increment the value of `$num` by 3. The resulting value of `$num` is 8, which is then output using the `echo` statement.
