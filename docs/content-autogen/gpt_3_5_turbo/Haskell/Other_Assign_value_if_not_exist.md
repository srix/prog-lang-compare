In Haskell, you can assign a value to a variable if it does not exist by using the `maybe` function. The `maybe` function takes two arguments: a default value and a `Maybe` value. If the `Maybe` value is `Just`, then the function returns the value inside the `Just` constructor. If the `Maybe` value is `Nothing`, then the default value is returned.

Here is an example of how to use `maybe` to assign a value if it does not exist:

```
maybeValue = Nothing
defaultValue = 42

newValue = maybe defaultValue id maybeValue
```

In this example, `maybeValue` is set to `Nothing`, meaning there is no value assigned to it. `defaultValue` is set to `42`, which we want to assign to `newValue` if `maybeValue` has no value.

We then use the `maybe` function to assign `maybeValue` to `newValue`, using `defaultValue` as the default value. In this case, `id` is used as the second argument to `maybe`, which is just a function that returns its input unchanged.

Since `maybeValue` is `Nothing`, the default value of `42` is returned and assigned to `newValue`.

However, if `maybeValue` had a value of, say, `Just 10`, then `10` would be returned instead and assigned to `newValue`.
