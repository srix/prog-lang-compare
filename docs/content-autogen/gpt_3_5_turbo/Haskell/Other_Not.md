In Haskell, `not` is a Boolean negation operator that takes a single argument of type Bool and returns a Boolean value that is the opposite of the argument. If the argument is True, not will return False and vice versa.

Here are some examples showing how to use `not` in Haskell:

```
not True      -- returns False
not False     -- returns True

-- A function that negates the result of another function
isEven n = n `mod` 2 == 0
isOdd = not . isEven

isOdd 3       -- returns True, because 3 is odd
isOdd 4       -- returns False, because 4 is even
```

In the first two examples, `not` is used with literal Boolean values `True` and `False`. In the last two examples, `not` is used in combination with function composition to build a new function that negates the result of another function.
