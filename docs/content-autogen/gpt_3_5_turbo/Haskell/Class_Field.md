In Haskell, a field refers to a named component of a data type. Fields are defined in the data declaration using the syntax:

```haskell
data TypeName = ConstructorName { field1 :: Type1, field2 :: Type2, ... }
```

Here, `TypeName` is the name of the data type, `ConstructorName` is the name of the constructor that creates values of the data type, and `field1` and `field2` are the names of the fields. Each field has a corresponding type (`Type1`, `Type2`, etc.).

Once you have defined a data type with fields, you can create values of the type and access the fields using record syntax. Here's an example:

```haskell
data Person = Person { name :: String, age :: Int }

alice :: Person
alice = Person { name = "Alice", age = 25 }

getName :: Person -> String
getName p = name p

getAge :: Person -> Int
getAge p = age p
```

In this example, we define a `Person` data type with two fields (`name` and `age`). We create a new value of type `Person` called `alice` using record syntax to set the values of the fields.

We can then define functions to access the fields of a `Person` value. `getName` takes a `Person` value and returns its `name` field, and `getAge` returns the `age` field.

We can use these functions like this:

```haskell
main = do
  putStrLn $ "Name: " ++ getName alice
  putStrLn $ "Age: " ++ (show (getAge alice))
```

This will print:

```
Name: Alice
Age: 25
```

In summary, using fields in Haskell classes involves defining data types with named fields in their constructors, and accessing those fields using record syntax when creating and manipulating values of the data type.
