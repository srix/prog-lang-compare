In Haskell, the first and last element of an array can be obtained using the `head` and `last` functions respectively. Here's an example:

```haskell
-- Define an array
let myArr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

-- Get the first element of the array
let firstElement = head myArr -- returns 1

-- Get the last element of the array
let lastElement = last myArr -- returns 5
```

In the above code, we define an array `myArr` containing integers from 1 to 5. We then use the `head` function to get the first element of the array, which is `1`. Similarly, we use the `last` function to get the last element of the array, which is `5`.
