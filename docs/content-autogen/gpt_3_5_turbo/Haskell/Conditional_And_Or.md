In Haskell, `and` and `or` are two built-in functions that take a list of Boolean values and return a Boolean result.

The `and` function returns `True` if all elements of the list are `True`, and `False` otherwise. Here's an example:

```
> and [True, True, False]
False

> and [True, True, True]
True
```

The `or` function returns `True` if at least one element of the list is `True`, and `False` otherwise. Here's an example:

```
> or [True, True, False]
True

> or [False, False, False]
False
```

You can also use `and` and `or` in conjunction with other functions in a more complex expression. For example:

```
> let list = [1,2,3,4]
> or (map (\x -> x `mod` 2 == 0) list)
True
```

This code uses `map` to check whether each element of `list` is even (by checking whether its remainder when divided by 2 is 0), and `or` to check whether at least one of those elements is even.
