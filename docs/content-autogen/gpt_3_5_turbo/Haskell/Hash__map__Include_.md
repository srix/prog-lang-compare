In Haskell, a hash is known as a Map in the Data.Map library. To check if a `Map` includes a key, we can use the `member` function that returns a boolean value `True` if the key is present in the map and `False` otherwise.

Here's an example of how to check if a Map includes a key:

```haskell
import qualified Data.Map as Map

-- Define a map
students :: Map.Map String Int
students = Map.fromList [("Alice", 90), ("Bob", 80), ("Charlie", 85)]

-- Check if "Alice" is a key in the map
Map.member "Alice" students
-- Output: True

-- Check if "David" is a key in the map
Map.member "David" students
-- Output: False
```

In this example, we define a `Map` called `students`, which maps student names to their scores. The `member` function is used to check if "Alice" and "David" are keys in the map. The first check returns `True` because "Alice" is a key in the `Map`, while the second check returns `False` because "David" is not a key in the `Map`.
