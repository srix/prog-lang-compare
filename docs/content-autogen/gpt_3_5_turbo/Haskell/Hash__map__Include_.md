In Haskell, we can check if a hash includes a key using the `Data.HashMap.Lazy.lookup` function which returns a `Maybe` value. A `Just` value indicates that the key exists in the hash and contains the corresponding value, while a `Nothing` value indicates that the key does not exist in the hash.

Here is an example of how to check if a key exists in a hash in Haskell:

```haskell
import qualified Data.HashMap.Lazy as Map

-- Define a hash
hash = Map.fromList [("apple", 1), ("banana", 2), ("orange", 3)]

-- Check if "apple" exists in the hash
appleExists = case Map.lookup "apple" hash of
               Just value -> True
               Nothing -> False
               
-- Check if "watermelon" exists in the hash
watermelonExists = case Map.lookup "watermelon" hash of
                   Just value -> True
                   Nothing -> False
                   
-- Print the results
main = do
    putStrLn $ "Does 'apple' exist in the hash? " ++ show appleExists
    putStrLn $ "Does 'watermelon' exist in the hash? " ++ show watermelonExists
```

The above code will output:

```
Does 'apple' exist in the hash? True
Does 'watermelon' exist in the hash? False
```
