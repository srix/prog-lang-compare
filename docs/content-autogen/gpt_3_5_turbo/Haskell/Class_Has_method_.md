In Haskell, we can check if a class has a method by using the `elem` function on the list of method names provided by the `methods` function of the class.

For example, let's check if the `Eq` class has a method called `(/=)` (not equal) using the following code:

```
elem "(/=)" $ methods (undefined :: Eq a => a -> a -> Bool)
```

Here, we use the `undefined` value to create a type constraint that ensures that the `Eq` class is used. The `methods` function returns a list of the names of the methods defined by the class, which we pass to the `elem` function along with the name of the method we want to check.

If the `(/=)` method is defined by the class, the expression will evaluate to `True`. Otherwise, it will evaluate to `False`.

Let's do another example. Let's check if the `Num` class has a method called `sin` using the following code:

```
elem "sin" $ methods (undefined :: Num a => a -> a)
```

Again, we use an undefined value with a type constraint to ensure we're using the `Num` class. The `methods` function will return a list of the names of the methods defined by the class and we pass this to the `elem` function along with the method name we want to check.

If the `sin` method is defined by the class, the expression will evaluate to `True`. Otherwise, it will evaluate to `False`.
