To get the size of an array in Haskell, you can use the `length` function which takes an array as an input and returns its size as an integer.

For example, let's say we have an array of integers:

```haskell
myArray = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```

We can get the size of this array by using the `length` function:

```haskell
arraySize = length myArray
```

This will set the `arraySize` variable to `5` which is the size of the `myArray`.

Another example of getting the size of a string array:

```haskell
myStringArray = ["apple", "banana", "orange", "grape"]
stringArraySize = length myStringArray
```

This will set the `stringArraySize` variable to `4` which is the size of the `myStringArray`.
