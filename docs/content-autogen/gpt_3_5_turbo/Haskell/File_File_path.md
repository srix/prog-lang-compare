In Haskell, you can get the file path using the `__FILE__` and `__LINE__` macros from the `Debug.Trace` module.

Here's an example:

```haskell
import Debug.Trace

main :: IO ()
main = do
  let filePath = trace (__FILE__ ++ " at line " ++ show __LINE__) "hello"
  putStrLn filePath
```

When you run this program, it will output something like:

```
/path/to/file.hs at line 7
hello
```

This shows the file path and line number where the `trace` function was called. You can use this technique to add debugging information to your Haskell code.
