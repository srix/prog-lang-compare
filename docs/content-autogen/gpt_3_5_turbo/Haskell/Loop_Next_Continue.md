In Haskell, both `next` and `continue` are not keywords. However, there are similar concepts that can provide their functionalities.

`next` in a loop typically means skipping the current iteration of the loop and moving on to the next iteration. In Haskell, we can achieve this using recursion.

Consider the following example of a function that prints numbers from 1 to 10, but skips number 5:

```
printNumbers :: Int -> IO()
printNumbers n
  | n > 10 = return ()
  | n == 5 = printNumbers (n + 1)
  | otherwise = do
      print n
      printNumbers (n + 1)
```

In this code, if `n` is equal to 5, the function calls itself with `n+1`, effectively skipping number 5.

`continue` in a loop typically means skipping the remaining code in the current iteration and moving on to the next iteration. In Haskell, we can achieve this using `guard` from the `Control.Monad` library.

Consider the following example of a function that prints only even numbers from 1 to 10:

```
import Control.Monad

printEvenNumbers :: Int -> IO()
printEvenNumbers n
  | n > 10 = return ()
  | otherwise = do
      guard $ even n
      print n
      printEvenNumbers (n + 1)
```

In this code, if `n` is not an even number, the `guard` function fails and the rest of the code in the iteration is skipped. The function then moves on to the next iteration.
