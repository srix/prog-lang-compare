In Haskell, a hash is known as a Map. A Map is a data structure that stores values in key-value pairs. The key is unique, and the value may be duplicated.

To add an element or pair to a Map in Haskell, you will need to use the `insert` function from the `Data.Map` module. The syntax for this function is as follows:

```
insert :: Ord k => k -> a -> Map k a -> Map k a
```
The first argument is the key, the second argument is the value to be associated with the key, and the third argument is the Map to which the pair will be added.

Here is an example of adding a key-value pair to a Map in Haskell:

```
import qualified Data.Map as Map

myMap :: Map.Map Char Int
myMap = Map.fromList [('a', 1), ('b', 2), ('c', 3)] -- create a Map with three key-value pairs

updatedMap = Map.insert 'd' 4 myMap -- add a new key 'd' with value 4 to the Map

```

In this example, we imported the `Data.Map` module and created a Map called `myMap` with three key-value pairs. We then used the `insert` function to add a new key-value pair to `myMap` and assigned the result to a new variable called `updatedMap`.

The updatedMap will now contain four key-value pairs: `('a', 1), ('b', 2), ('c', 3), ('d', 4)`.
