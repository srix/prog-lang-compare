In Haskell, there are different ways to concatenate strings.

One way is to use the `++` operator. The `++` operator is used to append two strings together to form a new string. Here's an example:

```haskell
concatenateString :: String -> String -> String
concatenateString s1 s2 = s1 ++ s2

main = do
   let str1 = "Hello "
       str2 = "World!"
   putStrLn (concatenateString str1 str2)
   -- Output will be "Hello World!"
```

In this example, we define a function named `concatenateString` that takes two `String` arguments, `s1` and `s2`. We then use the `++` operator to concatenate `s1` and `s2` together to form a new string.

Another way to concatenate strings is by using the `concat` function. The `concat` function takes a list of strings and concatenates them together into a single string. Here's an example:

```haskell
concatenateList :: [String] -> String
concatenateList sList = concat sList

main = do
   let sList = ["Hello ", "World!"]
   putStrLn (concatenateList sList)
   -- Output will be "Hello World!"
```

In this example, we define a function named `concatenateList` that takes a list of `String` arguments, `sList`. We then use the `concat` function to concatenate all the elements in `sList` together to form a new string.
