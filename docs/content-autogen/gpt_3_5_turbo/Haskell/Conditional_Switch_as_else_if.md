In Haskell, the `switch` statement from many other programming languages is replaced with the `case` statement, which is a type of pattern matching. However, we can simulate the use of `else if` in Haskell using multiple `case` statements within a single function using the `case` keyword.

Here is an example of how to use `case` statement as `else if` in Haskell:

```
-- Function that determines a person's age group
ageGroup :: Int -> String
ageGroup age = case age of
                x | x < 0 -> "Invalid age"
                  | x < 18 -> "Child"
                  | x < 40 -> "Young adult"
                  | x < 60 -> "Middle-aged adult"
                  | otherwise -> "Senior citizen"
```

In this code, the function `ageGroup` takes a single argument: the person's age as an integer. The `case` statement is used to check the value of `age` against a series of conditions, using `|` (or `guard`) notation. If `age` satisfies the first condition (`age < 0`), then "Invalid age" will be returned; if it satisfies the second condition (`age < 18`), then "Child" will be returned; and so on, until reaching the default clause `otherwise` which matches any value, returning "Senior citizen" as default age group.

So, calling `ageGroup` with `25` as argument will return "Young adult". This function can be used to simulate the same functionality as `else if` block, providing multiple conditions to be checked and handled accordingly in a much cleaner syntax than nested `if` statements.
