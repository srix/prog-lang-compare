Sure, in Haskell, a method can be referred to as a function.

To call a method in Haskell, we need to first define a class with its methods or functions, and then create an instance of that class. Once we have an instance of the class, we can call its functions using the following syntax:

```
instanceName.functionName
```

Here's an example of how to define a class "Person" with a method "introduce":

```haskell
class Person a where
    introduce :: a -> IO ()
```

The above code defines a class "Person" with a method "introduce" that takes an input of type "a" and returns an IO action. Here's how we can create an instance of this class and call the introduce method:

```haskell
data Student = Student {name :: String, age :: Int}

instance Person Student where
    introduce student = do
        putStrLn ("Hi, my name is " ++ name student ++ " and I am " ++ show (age student) ++ " years old.")

main = do
    let s = Student "Alice" 21
    introduce s
```

In the above code, we first define a Student data structure with two fields, "name" and "age". Then we create an instance of the "Person" class for the "Student" data structure. Finally, we define the "introduce" function for the "Student" instance and call it on an instance of the Student data structure named "s" in the main function. When we run this code, we'll get an output of:

```
Hi, my name is Alice and I am 21 years old.
```

This is just a basic example of how to call a method in Haskell. The syntax may change depending on the specific context and class implementation.
