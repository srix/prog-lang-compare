In Haskell, there are built-in functions to get the maximum and minimum of two numbers. Here is an example of how to use them:

```haskell
maxNum = max 5 7
-- maxNum will be 7

minNum = min 5 7
-- minNum will be 5
```

In the above code, `max` and `min` are the built-in functions for finding the maximum and minimum of two numbers respectively. In the first example, we use these functions to find the maximum of `5` and `7`. The result is stored in the variable `maxNum`, which will be `7`. In the second example, we use the same functions to find the minimum of `5` and `7`. The result is stored in the variable `minNum`, which will be `5`.
