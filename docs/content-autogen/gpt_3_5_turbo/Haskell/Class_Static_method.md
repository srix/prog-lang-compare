In Haskell, you can define a static method in a class by using the `class` keyword followed by the class name, then the method name and its signature. Then, you can define the method implementation using the `instance` keyword and the class name followed by the method name and the implementation.

Here's an example:

```haskell
class MyStaticClass a where
  myStaticMethod :: a -> Int

instance MyStaticClass Int where
  myStaticMethod x = x + 1

instance MyStaticClass Bool where
  myStaticMethod x = if x then 1 else 0
```

In this example, we define a static class `MyStaticClass` with a static method `myStaticMethod` that takes an argument of type `a` and returns an `Int`. We then define two instances of this class for two different types, `Int` and `Bool`, and provide implementations for the static method for each of them.

In the first instance, we implement the static method for the `Int` type by returning the value of the argument plus one. In the second instance, we implement the method for the `Bool` type by returning one if the argument is `True` and zero otherwise.

To use these static methods, you can simply call them using the class name and the syntax `classMethod argument`:

```haskell
main = do
  print $ MyStaticClass.myStaticMethod (5 :: Int)
  print $ MyStaticClass.myStaticMethod True
```

This will output:

```
