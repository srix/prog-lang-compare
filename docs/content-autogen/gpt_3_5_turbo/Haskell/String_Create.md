In Haskell, a string is a list of characters. We can create a string in Haskell using double quotes (") or single quotes ('). Here are a few examples:

Using Double Quotes:

We can create a string using double quotes. For example:

```
myString1 = "Hello, World!"
```

Using Single Quotes:

We can create a string using single quotes too. For example:

```
myString2 = 'Haskell is awesome!'
```

Using List of Characters:

As a string is a list of characters in Haskell, we can simply define a list of characters as a string. For example:

```
myString3 = ['H', 'a', 's', 'k', 'e', 'l', 'l']
```

In Haskell, these three examples are equivalent and we can perform string operations on them in the same way.
