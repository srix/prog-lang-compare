In Kotlin, there are two types of comments: single-line and multi-line comments. 

Single-line comments begin with two forward slashes `//` and they only comment on the line they are on. For example: 

```
// This is a single-line comment
val name = "John" // This is also a single-line comment
```

Multi-line comments begin with `/*` and end with `*/`. They can span over multiple lines and can add a description of a block of code. For example: 

```
/* This is a multi-line comment that can explain a block
   of code that does something really complicated. */
fun doSomething() {
   // Do something here
}
```

It is considered good programming practice to add comments to explain complex or unclear sections of your code.
