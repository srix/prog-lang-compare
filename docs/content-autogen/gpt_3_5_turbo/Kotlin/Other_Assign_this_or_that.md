In Kotlin, the "this" and "that" keywords are not used for variable assignment. Instead, you can assign values directly to variables using the equals sign (=). Here is an example:

```kotlin
// Assigning a value to a variable called "this"
val thisIsAString = "This is a string."

// Assigning a value to a variable called "that"
val thatIsANumber = 42
```

In the above example, we assign a string value to a variable called `thisIsAString` using the `val` keyword and an equals sign (=). Likewise, we assign an integer value to a variable called `thatIsANumber`. These variables can be used later in the code to retrieve or modify their values.
