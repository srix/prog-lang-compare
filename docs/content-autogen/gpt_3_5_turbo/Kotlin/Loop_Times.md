In Kotlin, times are represented by the `*` operator. Here are some examples of how to use times in Kotlin:

1. Multiplication of Numbers: You can use times to multiply two numbers in Kotlin.

```
val a = 5
val b = 3
val result = a * b
println(result)
```
Output: 15

2. Repeat String: You can use times to repeat a string a certain number of times.

```
val message = "Hello"
val repeatedMessage = message * 3
println(repeatedMessage)
```
Output: "HelloHelloHello"

3. Create List of Repeated Elements: You can use times to create a list of repeated elements.

```
val repeatedElements = listOf(0, 1, 2) * 3
println(repeatedElements)
```
Output: [0, 1, 2, 0, 1, 2, 0, 1, 2]
