Sure, creating a string in Kotlin is quite easy. Here is the basic syntax to create a string in Kotlin:

```kotlin
val str: String = "Hello, World!"
```

In this example, we are creating a string variable `str` with the value "Hello, World!". 

Here are a few more examples of creating strings in Kotlin:

```kotlin
// Using double quotes
val str1 = "This is a string."

// Using triple quotes for multi-line strings
val str2 = """
    This is a multi-line string.
    It can span multiple lines.
    """
    
// Using String constructor
val str3 = String(charArrayOf('h', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o'))
```

In the first example, the string is created using double quotes. In the second example, we are using triple quotes to create a multi-line string. And in the third example, we are creating a string using the `String` constructor by passing an array of characters. 

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.
