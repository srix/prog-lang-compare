In Kotlin, the `&&` operator is used to indicate a logical AND, while `||` is used for a logical OR.

Here are several examples to explain how to use `||` and `&&` operators in Kotlin:

### Using `&&` operator:

```kotlin
val x: Int = 5
val y: Int = 10

// using && to check if both statements are true
if (x > 0 && y < 15) {
   println("Both conditions are true")
} else {
   println("At least one condition is false")
}
```

In this example, the `if` statement uses `&&` to check if both conditions are true. Since `x` is greater than 0 and `y` is less than 15, the message "Both conditions are true" will be printed.

### Using `||` operator:

```kotlin
// using || to check if at least one condition is true
if (x > 0 || y > 15) {
   println("At least one condition is true")
} else {
   println("Both conditions are false")
}
```

In this example, the `if` statement uses `||` to check if at least one condition is true. Since `x` is greater than 0 and `y` is greater than 15, the message "At least one condition is true" will be printed.

### Combining operators:

```kotlin
val z: Int = 7

// using && and || together
if ((x > 0 && y < 15) || z == 7) {
   println("At least one condition is true")
} else {
   println("Both conditions are false")
}
```

In this example, the `if` statement uses both `&&` and `||` to check if either `x` is greater than 0 and `y` is less than 15, or if `z` equals 7. Since `z` equals 7, the message "At least one condition is true" will be printed.
