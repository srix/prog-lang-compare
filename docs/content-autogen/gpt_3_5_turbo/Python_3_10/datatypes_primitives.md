In Python 3.10, there are four primitive types: 

1. Integer (int): It represents non-fractional numbers and can be either positive or negative. Examples of int include 1, 2, -3, etc. 

2. Float: It represents real numbers and includes numbers with a decimal point or an exponent. Examples of float include 3.14, -2.1, 2e-4, etc.

3. Boolean (bool): It represents truth values and can either be True or False. Examples of bool include True, False.

4. String (str): It represents a sequence of characters enclosed in single quotes, double quotes, or triple quotes. Examples of str include "Hello", 'World', "I'm happy", etc.

Here are some examples: 

```
# Integer
age = 25
print(age) # Output: 25

# Float
pi = 3.14
print(pi) # Output: 3.14

# Boolean
is_sunny = True
print(is_sunny) # Output: True

# String
name = "John"
print(name) # Output: John
``` 

Note that Python is a dynamically typed language, meaning you don't have to explicitly declare the type of a variable. It is determined dynamically at the runtime based on the value assigned to it.
