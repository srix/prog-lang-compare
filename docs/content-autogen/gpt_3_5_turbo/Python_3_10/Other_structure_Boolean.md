Boolean is a built-in data type in Python that is used to represent truth values, which can either be True or False. Boolean values are usually the result of a comparison operation or a logical operation in Python.

Here are some examples of how to use Booleans in Python 3.10:

Example 1: Checking if a number is greater than another number

```python
x = 10
y = 5
print(x > y)  # Outputs True
print(y > x)  # Outputs False
```

In the above example, the greater than operator (`>`) compares the values of x and y. Since 10 is greater than 5, the expression `x > y` evaluates to True.

Example 2: Using Boolean values as the result of a function

```python
def is_even(number):
    return number % 2 == 0

print(is_even(4))  # Outputs True
print(is_even(3))  # Outputs False
```

In the above example, the function `is_even` returns True if the given number is even and False otherwise. The modulo operator (`%`) is used to check if the number is even. If the remainder of dividing the number by 2 is 0, then the number is even and the function returns True.

Example 3: Using logical operators to combine Boolean values

```python
x = 5
y = 3
z = 7
print(x < y or x < z)  # Outputs True
print(x < y and x < z) # Outputs False
print(not x < y)       # Outputs True
```

In the above example, the logical operators (`or`, `and`, and `not`) are used to combine Boolean values. The `or` operator returns True if at least one of the expressions is True, while the `and` operator returns True only if both expressions are True. The `not` operator negates the value of the expression.
