Sure, here is how to run a command in Python 3.10 with an example:

1. Open your command prompt or terminal.
2. Navigate to the directory where your Python script is saved.
3. Type "python" followed by the name of your Python file (with the .py extension) and press enter.

Example:

Let's assume we have a Python script called "hello.py" saved in the directory "C:\Users\Hello World". Here's how we can run it-

1. Open command prompt or terminal.
2. Navigate to the directory "C:\Users\Hello World".
3. Type "python hello.py" and press enter.

The command prompt/terminal will execute the Python script and display the output if there is any.
You can also run Python commands using the built-in Python interpreter in your terminal. After opening the command prompt or terminal, simply type "python" and press enter. You will be taken to the Python interpreter, where you can run your Python commands.
