In Python 3.10, the `__len__()` method is available to return the number of key-value pairs in a hash (dict). The syntax to get the size of a hash in Python 3.10 is as follows:

```
len(hash)
```

Here is an example:

```python
# create a hash
my_dict = {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}

# get the size of the hash
size = len(my_dict)

# print the size of the hash
print(f"The size of the hash is {size}")
```

The output will be:

```
The size of the hash is 3
```

In this example, we have created a hash (dict) called `my_dict` with 3 key-value pairs. The `len()` function is then used to get the size of the hash, which is 3. The size is stored in the `size` variable and printed to the console using `print()` function with an f-string.
