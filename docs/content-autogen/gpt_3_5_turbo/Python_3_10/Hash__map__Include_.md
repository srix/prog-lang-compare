In Python 3.10, checking if a hash includes a key can be done using the `in` operator.

Here is an example:

```python
# Define a hash
my_dict = {"apple": 2, "banana": 4, "orange": 1}

# Check if a key exists in the hash
if "apple" in my_dict:
    print("Yes, 'apple' is a key in the hash.")
else:
    print("No, 'apple' is not a key in the hash.")
```

In this example, `"apple"` is a key in the hash, so the output will be `"Yes, 'apple' is a key in the hash."`

Here's another example:

```python
# Define a hash
my_dict = {"cat": "meow", "dog": "woof", "bird": "chirp"}

# Check if a key exists in the hash
if "monkey" in my_dict:
    print("Yes, 'monkey' is a key in the hash.")
else:
    print("No, 'monkey' is not a key in the hash.")
```

In this example, `"monkey"` is not a key in the hash, so the output will be `"No, 'monkey' is not a key in the hash."`
