In Python 3.10, you can use the `in` operator to check if a hash includes a key or not.

Here is an example code snippet:

```python
person = {"name": "Alice", "age": 30, "gender": "female"}

# Checking if a key exists
if "name" in person:
    print("Name exists in the dictionary")

# Checking if a key does not exist
if "occupation" not in person:
    print("Occupation does not exist in the dictionary")
```

The output of this code would be:

```
Name exists in the dictionary
Occupation does not exist in the dictionary
```

In the above example, we have a dictionary called `person` with keys `"name"`, `"age"`, and `"gender"`. We check if `"name"` exists in the dictionary using the `in` operator, and if it does, we print a message. Similarly, we check if `"occupation"` does not exist in the dictionary using the `not in` operator and print a message accordingly.
