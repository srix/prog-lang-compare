In Python, get/set methods are used to access and modify the properties of a class. They provide a way to encapsulate the class variables (also known as class properties) and make them private, so they can only be accessed through these methods.

In Python 3.10, you can use the `@property` and `@<property>.setter` decorators to define get/set methods.

Example code:

```python
class Car:
    def __init__(self, make, model, year, price):
        self._make = make
        self._model = model
        self._year = year
        self._price = price

    @property
    def make(self):
        return self._make

    @make.setter
    def make(self, make):
        self._make = make

    @property
    def model(self):
        return self._model

    @model.setter
    def model(self, model):
        self._model = model

    @property
    def year(self):
        return self._year

    @year.setter
    def year(self, year):
        self._year = year

    @property
    def price(self):
        return self._price

    @price.setter
    def price(self, price):
        self._price = price
```

In the example above, we create a `Car` class with four properties - `make`, `model`, `year`, and `price`. To define get/set methods for each of these properties, we use the `@property` and `@<property>.setter` decorators. 

The `@property` decorator creates a read-only property that returns the value of the private variable. We define a setter method for each property using the `<property>.setter` decorator, which allows us to modify the value of the private variable when the property is assigned a new value.

With this implementation, we can create a new car and get/set the values of its properties like this:

```python
my_car = Car('Ford', 'Mustang', 2022, 35000)

# Get the make
make = my_car.make
print(make)  # Output: 'Ford'

# Set the make
my_car.make = 'Chevrolet'
print(my_car.make)  # Output: 'Chevrolet'
```

In summary, get/set methods provide an elegant way to access and modify class properties in Python. By using the `@property` and `@<property>.setter` decorators, we can encapsulate properties and make them private, while still allowing external access through the methods.
