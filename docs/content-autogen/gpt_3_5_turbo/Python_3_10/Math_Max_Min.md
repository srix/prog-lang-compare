In Python 3.10, you can use the `math.max()` and `math.min()` functions to get the maximum and minimum of two numbers. Here are some examples:

```python
import math

# Example 1: Find the maximum of two numbers
num1 = 10
num2 = 20
max_num = math.max(num1, num2)
print(max_num)  # Output: 20

# Example 2: Find the minimum of two numbers
num1 = 30
num2 = 15
min_num = math.min(num1, num2)
print(min_num)  # Output: 15

# Example 3: Find the maximum of two floating-point numbers
num1 = 3.1415
num2 = 2.7182
max_num = math.max(num1, num2)
print(max_num)  # Output: 3.1415
```

As you can see from these examples, the `math.max()` and `math.min()` functions can be used with both integers and floating-point numbers to find the maximum and minimum of two numbers.
