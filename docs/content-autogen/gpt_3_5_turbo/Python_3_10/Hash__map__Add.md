Sure, here's an explanation on how to add an element to a hash (dictionary) in Python 3.10:

In Python, a hash (or dictionary) is a collection of key-value pairs (also known as items). To add an element to a hash, we need to specify the key-value pair we want to add.

Here's the general syntax for adding an element to a hash:

```python
my_dict[key] = value
```

where `my_dict` is the name of the dictionary, `key` is the key of the element we want to add, and `value` is the value of the element we want to add.

Here's an example:

```python
# create a dictionary
my_dict = {'apple': 2, 'banana': 3, 'orange': 4}

# add a new element
my_dict['kiwi'] = 5

# print the updated dictionary
print(my_dict)
# Output: {'apple': 2, 'banana': 3, 'orange': 4, 'kiwi': 5}
```

In this example, we first create a dictionary `my_dict` with three key-value pairs. Then, we add a new element with the key `'kiwi'` and value `5` using the `my_dict['kiwi'] = 5` syntax. Lastly, we print the updated dictionary which includes the new key-value pair.

I hope this explanation helps!
