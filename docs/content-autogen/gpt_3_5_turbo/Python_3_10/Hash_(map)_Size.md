In Python 3.10, the `len()` function can be used to determine the size of a hash. Here is an example:

```
my_dict = {"a": 1, "b": 2, "c": 3}
print(len(my_dict))
```

Output:
```
3
```

In this example, we have defined a hash as a dictionary `my_dict` with 3 items. We then print the length of the hash using `len()` function, which returns the number of key-value pairs in the hash, which is 3 in this case.
