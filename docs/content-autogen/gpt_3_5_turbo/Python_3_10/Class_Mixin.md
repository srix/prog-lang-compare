Mixin is a concept in object-oriented programming where a class can reuse code from another class without inheriting from it. Python 3.10 introduces a new syntax for using mixins called `case`. Here's an example of how to use mixins in Python 3.10:

```python
from typing import Type, Protocol

class Loggable(Protocol):
    def log(self, message: str):
        ...

def with_logging(cls: Type):
    class Logged(cls):
        def log(self, message):
            print(f"{self.__class__.__name__}: {message}")
    return Logged

@with_logging
class MyClass:
    def foo(self):
        pass

my_object = MyClass()
my_object.log("Hello, world!")
```

In this example, we define a `Loggable` protocol that declares a `log` method. We then define a `with_logging` function that takes a class and returns a new class that inherits from the original class and adds a `log` method that prints out a message. We use Python 3.10's new `case` syntax to decorate the `MyClass` definition with the `with_logging` function.

Finally, we create an instance of `MyClass` and call the `log` method on it, which was added by the `with_logging` mixin. The output of this code will be:

```
MyClass: Hello, world!
```

So we can see that by using a mixin, we have added behavior to an existing class without having to modify the class directly.
