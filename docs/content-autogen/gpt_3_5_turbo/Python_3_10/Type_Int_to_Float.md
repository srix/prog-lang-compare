Converting an integer to a float in Python is a simple process. You can simply use the float() function to do the conversion. Here's an example:

```python
# Converting an integer to a float using the float() function
integer_number = 10
float_number = float(integer_number)
print(float_number)  # Output: 10.0
```

In this example, the `float()` function takes an integer value of `10` as an argument and converts it to a float value of `10.0`.

You can also do the conversion during arithmetic calculations like so:

```python
# Converting an integer to a float during arithmetic calculations
integer_number_1 = 10
integer_number_2 = 5
float_number = integer_number_1 / float(integer_number_2)
print(float_number)  # Output: 2.0
```

In this example, the `integer_number_1` is divided by `integer_number_2` and the result is automatically converted to a float value before being assigned to `float_number`.

It is important to note that, in Python, integer division returns integer, while float division returns a float. Therefore, always use the `float()` function when converting an integer to a float before performing division operations that require float results.
