Certainly.

In Python 3.10, the `for` loop is used to iterate over a sequence of values. Here are some examples:

1. Loop over a list:
   
   ```python
   names = ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie']
   for name in names:
       print(name)
   ```
   Output:
   ```
   Alice
   Bob
   Charlie
   ```
   
2. Loop over a range of numbers:

   ```python
   for i in range(5):
       print(i)
   ```
   Output:
   ```
   0
   1
   2
   3
   4
   ```
   
3. Loop over a string:

   ```python
   message = 'Hello, World!'
   for char in message:
       print(char)
   ```
   Output:
   ```
   H
   e
   l
   l
   o
   ,
    
   W
   o
   r
   l
   d
   !
   ```

4. Loop over a dictionary:
   
   ```python
   scores = {'Alice': 90, 'Bob': 80, 'Charlie': 70}
   for name, score in scores.items():
       print(name, score)
   ```
   Output:
   ```
   Alice 90
   Bob 80
   Charlie 70
   ```
