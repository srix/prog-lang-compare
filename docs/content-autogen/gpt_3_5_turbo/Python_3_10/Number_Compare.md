In Python 3.10, you can compare numbers using comparison operators. The following comparison operators are available:

- `>` (greater than)
- `<` (less than)
- `>=` (greater than or equal to)
- `<=` (less than or equal to)
- `==` (equal to)
- `!=` (not equal to)

Here are some examples:

```python
# greater than
5 > 3  # True
10 > 20  # False

# less than
2 < 8  # True
15 < 5  # False

# greater than or equal to
3 >= 3  # True
4 >= 5  # False

# less than or equal to
7 <= 10  # True
2 <= 1  # False

# equal to
6 == 6  # True
7 == 9  # False

# not equal to
10 != 5  # True
2 != 2  # False
```

You can use these comparison operators to create conditional statements that make decisions based on the comparison result.
