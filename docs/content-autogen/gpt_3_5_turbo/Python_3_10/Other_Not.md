Sure! 

In Python 3.10, `not` is a keyword that can be used for logical negation. It takes a single boolean value and returns the opposite boolean value.

Here are some examples to illustrate how to use `not` in Python 3.10:

Example 1:

```python
x = True
y = not x
print(y)   # False
```

In this example, we assign the boolean value `True` to variable `x`. We then apply the `not` operator to `x` and assign the result to variable `y`. The `not` operator returns the opposite of `True`, which is `False`. Finally, we print the value of `y`, which is `False`.

Example 2:

```python
x = 10
if not x < 5:
    print("x is greater than or equal to 5")
```

In this example, we use the `not` operator to check if the value of `x` is greater than or equal to 5. We apply the `<` operator to `x` and compare it to the value 5. However, we use the `not` operator to negate the result of this comparison, so that the code inside the if statement is executed only if `x` is greater than or equal to 5. In this case, the output will be "x is greater than or equal to 5".

Example 3:

```python
x = None
if not x:
    print("x is None or False")
```

In this example, we check if the value of `x` is `None` or `False`. We use the `not` operator to negate the boolean value of `x`. Since `None` and `False` are both "falsey" values in Python, the `not` operator will return `True` when applied to them. In this case, the output will be "x is None or False".

I hope that helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.
