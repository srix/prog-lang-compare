In Python, we use the hash symbol or octothorpe (#) to write comments. A comment is a line of text that is not executed by the Python interpreter. It serves as an explanation or clarification of the code. 

Here are some examples of how to write comments in Python 3.10:

### Single-line Comment
To write a single-line comment in Python, simply start the line with the hash symbol #. For example:

``` python
# This is a single-line comment in Python
print("Hello World") # This is also a comment
```

### Multi-line Comment
To write a multi-line comment in Python, use triple quotes, either single or double. These comments can span over multiple lines. For example:

``` python
"""
This is a multi-line 
comment in Python
"""

print("Hello World") # This is also a comment
```

### Inline Comments
To write a comment alongside a line of code, use the hash symbol after the code. For example:

``` python
x = 5 # This is an inline comment
print(x) # Output: 5
```

By commenting our code properly, not only do we make it more readable and understandable, but it also becomes easier to maintain and debug in the future.
