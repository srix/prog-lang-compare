In Python 3.10, you can use the `+` operator to concatenate two arrays. Here's an example:

```python
arr1 = [1, 2, 3]
arr2 = [4, 5, 6]
concatenated_arr = arr1 + arr2
print(concatenated_arr)
```

Output:

```
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
```

In this example, we have two arrays `arr1` and `arr2`. We concatenate them using the `+` operator and assign the result to a new variable `concatenated_arr`. Then we print the concatenated array. As you can see, the output is a new array that contains all the elements of `arr1` and `arr2`.
