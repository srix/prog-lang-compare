In Python, a hash is represented by the `dict` data type, which is short for dictionary. To iterate over a hash (dictionary) in Python 3.10, you can use a `for` loop or the `items` method.

Here is an example of using a `for` loop to iterate over a dictionary:

```python
# Creating a dictionary
my_dict = {'key1': 'value1', 'key2': 'value2', 'key3': 'value3'}

# Iterating over the dictionary using for loop
for key in my_dict:
    print(key, my_dict[key])
```

Output:
```
key1 value1
key2 value2
key3 value3
```

Alternatively, you can use the `items()` method, which returns a list of tuples containing the key-value pairs of the dictionary. Here is an example:

```python
# Creating a dictionary
my_dict = {'key1': 'value1', 'key2': 'value2', 'key3': 'value3'}

# Iterating over the dictionary using the items() method
for key, value in my_dict.items():
    print(key, value)
```

Output:
```
key1 value1
key2 value2
key3 value3
```

In both examples, we are iterating through each key-value pair in the dictionary and printing them.
