Floating point numbers or simply floats are numbers that contain decimal points. In Python 3.10 you can use float numbers to perform mathematical calculations involving decimals. Here are some examples of float numbers in Python 3.10:

```
# Defining float variables
x = 12.5
y = 1.23

# Addition with float numbers
z = x + y  
print(z) # Output: 13.73

# Subtraction with float numbers
z = x - y
print(z) # Output: 11.27

# Multiplication with float numbers
z = x * y
print(z) # Output: 15.375

# Division with float numbers
z = x / y
print(z) # Output: 10.16260162601626
```

In the above code, we have defined two float variables `x` and `y` and performed different mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The output is printed using the `print()` function.```
