Sure! Converting an integer to a string in Python 3.10 is fairly straightforward. You can simply use the `str()` function to achieve this. 

Here are a few examples:

Example 1: Using the `str()` function

```python
#Converting integer to string using the str() function
num = 123
str_num = str(num)
print("The type of num is", type(num))
print("The type of str_num is", type(str_num))
```

Output:
```
The type of num is <class 'int'>
The type of str_num is <class 'str'>
```

Example 2: Using f-strings

```python
#Converting integer to string using f-strings
num = 123
str_num = f"{num}"
print("The type of num is", type(num))
print("The type of str_num is", type(str_num))
```

Output:
```
The type of num is <class 'int'>
The type of str_num is <class 'str'>
```

Both examples accomplish the same thing. In the first example, we use the `str()` function to convert an integer to a string. In the second example, we take advantage of f-strings and simply wrap the integer with curly braces and a preceding 'f' to convert it to a string.
