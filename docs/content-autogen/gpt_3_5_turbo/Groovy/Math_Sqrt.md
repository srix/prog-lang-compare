In Groovy, you can get the square root of a number using the `Math.sqrt()` method. 

Here's an example of how to get the square root of a number:

``` groovy
def num = 16
def sqrtNum = Math.sqrt(num)
println "Square root of $num is $sqrtNum"
```

This will output:

```
Square root of 16 is 4.0
```

You can also directly get the square root of a number without assigning it to a variable:

``` groovy
println Math.sqrt(25)
```

This will output:

```
5.0
```
