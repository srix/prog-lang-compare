In Groovy, there are multiple ways to assign a value if it does not exist. One of the most common ways is to use the `?:` operator, also known as the Elvis operator. This operator returns the value on the left-hand side if it is not null, otherwise, it returns the value on the right-hand side. Here is an example:

```groovy
def name = null
def defaultName = "John"

// Assign defaultName since name is null
name = name ?: defaultName

println name // Output: John
```

In the above example, the `name` variable is assigned the value of `defaultName` since it is initially null.

Another way to assign a value if it does not exist is to use the `?.` operator, also known as the Safe Navigation operator. This operator allows you to safely navigate through a chain of properties or method calls, returning null if any intermediate object in the chain is null. Here is an example:

```groovy
def person = ["name":"John"]
def age = person.age?.toString() ?: "Unknown"

println age // Output: Unknown
```

In the above example, the `age` variable is assigned the value of `"Unknown"` since the `person.age` property does not exist. The `?.` operator prevents a `NullPointerException` from being thrown if the `person` object is null or its `age` property is null.

Both of these operators can be useful for assigning default values or handling null values in Groovy.
