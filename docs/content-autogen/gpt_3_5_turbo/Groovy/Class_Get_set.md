In Groovy, get/set methods provide a way to access and modify properties of a class. Here's an example:

```
class Person {
    private String name
    private int age

    public String getName() {
        return name
    }

    public void setName(String name) {
        this.name = name
    }

    public int getAge() {
        return age
    }

    public void setAge(int age) {
        this.age = age
    }
}
```

In this example, the `Person` class has two properties: `name` and `age`. For each property, there is a `get` method to retrieve the value and a `set` method to modify the value. The `get` methods have a return type that matches the type of the property, and the `set` methods take a parameter of the same type.

Here's an example of how to use the `Person` class:

```
def person = new Person()
person.setName("Alice")
person.setAge(30)
println("Person name: ${person.getName()}, age: ${person.getAge()}") // Output: Person name: Alice, age: 30
```

In this example, we create a new `Person` object, set the name and age properties using the `set` methods, and then retrieve the values using the `get` methods.

Alternatively, in Groovy, we can directly access the properties of the class, instead of using the get/set methods, like shown below:

```
class Person {
    String name
    int age
}

def person = new Person(name: "Alice", age: 30)
println("Person name: ${person.name}, age: ${person.age}") // Output: Person name: Alice, age: 30
```

This way of accessing properties is achieved by default property accessors generated by Groovy for classes that don't have get/set methods.
