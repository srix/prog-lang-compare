In Groovy, you can add comments in your code to explain what it does, how it works, or just to leave notes for yourself or other developers.

There are two ways to add comments in Groovy.

1. Single-line comments:

Single-line comments start with two forward slashes (`//`). Everything that comes after the `//` on the same line will be ignored by the compiler.

Here's an example:

```
// This is a single-line comment in Groovy

def x = 10 // This is a variable declaration
```

2. Multi-line comments:

Multi-line comments start with `/*` and end with `*/`. Everything between these two symbols will be ignored by the compiler.

Here's an example:

```
/*
This is a multi-line comment in Groovy.
You can write as many lines as you want here.
*/

def y = 20 /* This is another variable declaration */
```

It's important to add comments in your code to make it more readable and understandable. It also makes it easier for other developers to work with your code.
