In Groovy, the `tofloat()` method can be used to convert an integer to a float. Here's an example:

```
def intNum = 10
def floatNum = intNum.tofloat()
println(floatNum) // Output: 10.0
```

In this example, the integer value `10` is assigned to the variable `intNum`. The `tofloat()` method is then called on `intNum` to convert it to a float value, which is assigned to the variable `floatNum`. The `println()` statement outputs the value of `floatNum`, which is `10.0`.
