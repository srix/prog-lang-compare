Sure! Adding an element to an array in Groovy can be done in a few different ways. Here are some examples:

1. Using the `+` operator:
```
def myArray = [1, 2, 3]
myArray = myArray + 4
println myArray // Prints [1, 2, 3, 4]
```

2. Using the `<<` operator:
```
def myArray = [1, 2, 3]
myArray << 4
println myArray // Prints [1, 2, 3, 4]
```

3. Using the `add()` method:
```
def myArray = [1, 2, 3]
myArray.add(4)
println myArray // Prints [1, 2, 3, 4]
```

I hope that helps! Let me know if you have any questions.
