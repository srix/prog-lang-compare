In Rust, writing to a file involves a few steps:

1. Open the file for writing.
2. Write the desired content to the file.
3. Close the file.

Here is an example code snippet that demonstrates how to write to a file in Rust:

```rust
use std::fs::File;
use std::io::prelude::*;

fn main() -> std::io::Result<()> {
    let mut file = File::create("output.txt")?;
    file.write_all(b"Hello, world!")?;
    Ok(())
}
```

In this example, we first `use` the `File` and `prelude` modules from the `std::io` library. Then, We create a new file named `output.txt` using the `File::create()` function. This function returns a `Result<File>`, which is a Rust type that indicates whether the operation succeeded or not.

Then, we write the content to the file using the `write_all()` function, which takes a byte slice as an argument. In this case, we pass the byte slice containing the string "Hello, world!".

Finally, we `return` the `Ok(())` value to indicate that the operation completed successfully.

Note that while this example uses `?` to propagate errors, proper error handling is an important aspect when writing robust Rust code.
