Sure, I'd be happy to explain! In Rust 1.55, you can import libraries using the `use` keyword followed by the name of the library you want to import. For example, to import the `std::io` module, you would use the following code:

```rust
use std::io;
```

You can also use the `as` keyword to give the imported module a different name, like this:

```rust
use std::io as my_io;
```

Here's an example of importing both the `io` and `fs` modules from the `std` library:

```rust
use std::{io, fs};
```

You can also use the `*` wildcard character to import all the public items from a module:

```rust
use std::io::*;
```

This would import all the public items from the `io` module, including things like `stdin`, `stdout`, and `stderr`.

Lastly, you can import items from a specific module and include them in the current scope using the `pub use` syntax. For example, if you wanted to use the `HashMap` type from the `std::collections` module within your own module, you could do the following:

```rust
pub use std::collections::HashMap;
```

This would allow you to use `HashMap` without needing to prefix it with `std::collections::`.
