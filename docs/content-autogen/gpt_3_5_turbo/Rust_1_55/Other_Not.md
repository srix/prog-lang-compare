In Rust, the `not` operator is represented by the exclamation mark symbol `!`. It is a logical operator that negates the result of the expression that follows it. 

Here are some examples of how the `not` operator can be used in Rust:

```rust
// Negate a boolean value
let is_true = true;
let is_not_true = !is_true; // false

// Negate an expression
let x = 5;
let is_not_one = !(x == 1); // true

// Use not operator in if conditions
let is_false = false;
if !is_false {
    println!("This will be printed because is_false is not true");
}

// Use not operator in a loop
let mut i = 0;
while !i.eq(&5) {
    println!("{}", i);
    i += 1;
}
```

In the above examples, the `not` operator is used to negate a boolean value, an expression, and to facilitate `if` conditions or loops.
