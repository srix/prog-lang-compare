In Rust 1.55, you can get the file path using the `std::env::current_dir()` function which returns a `std::io::Result<PathBuf>` representing the current working directory. This can be combined with the `std::path::PathBuf::join()` method to construct a full path to a file. Here is an example:

```rust
use std::env;
use std::path::PathBuf;

fn main() {
    let current_dir = env::current_dir().expect("Failed to get current directory");
    let file_path = current_dir.join("example.txt");

    println!("File path: {:?}", file_path);
}
```

In this example, we first call `env::current_dir()` to get the current working directory. We then use the `join()` method on the resulting `PathBuf` to append the file name "example.txt" to the end of the path. Finally, we print out the resulting file path using the `println!()` macro.

Note that `current_dir()` returns a `Result` type that needs to be properly handled with `expect()` or `unwrap()`. This is because it could return an error if the current directory does not exist or the program lacks permissions to access it.
