In Rust 1.55, you can use the `std::env::current_dir()` function to get the current working directory path. Here's an example:

```rust
use std::env;

fn main() {
    // Get the current working directory path
    let current_dir = env::current_dir().unwrap();

    // Print the current working directory path
    println!("Current working directory path: {:?}", current_dir);
}
```

This will print out something like:

```
Current working directory path: "/Users/username/projects/my_project"
```

Note that `current_dir()` returns a `Result` type, so you need to handle any errors that may occur. In this example, we're using `.unwrap()` to unwrap the `Ok` variant of the `Result`, which will panic if an error occurs. However, you should handle the error appropriately in a real-world application.

Also note that the returned path is an OS-specific `PathBuf`, which can be converted to a string using the `.to_string_lossy()` method. For example:

```rust
let current_dir = env::current_dir().unwrap().to_string_lossy();
println!("Current working directory path: {}", current_dir);
```

This will print out the same thing as the previous example.
