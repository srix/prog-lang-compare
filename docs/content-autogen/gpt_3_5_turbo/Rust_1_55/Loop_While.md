The `while` loop in Rust 1.55 is used to execute a block of code continuously as long as a specified condition is true. The syntax of the while loop in Rust is as follows:

```
while condition {
    // code to be executed
}
```

The `condition` can be a Boolean expression, a comparison, or any other expression that returns a Boolean value. The code inside the loop will continue to execute as long as the condition is true.

Here is an example of using `while` loop to print numbers from 1 to 10:

```
let mut i = 1;

while i <= 10 {
    println!("{}", i);
    i += 1;
}
```

In this example, the `while` loop is used to execute the block of code that prints the value of `i` on the console. The loop continues to execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to 10. Once `i` becomes 11, the condition becomes false, and the loop terminates.

Another example could be using `while` loop to find the factorial of a number:

```
let mut n = 5;
let mut fact = 1;

while n > 0 {
    fact *= n;
    n -= 1;
}

println!("Factorial is {}", fact);
```

In this example, we use `while` loop to calculate the factorial of a number. The loop continues to execute as long as `n` is greater than 0. In each iteration, we calculate the factorial by multiplying the `fact` variable by `n`, then decrement `n` by 1. The loop will continue until `n` becomes 0 and the factorial is calculated. Finally, we print the calculated factorial on the console.

In summary, the `while` loop in Rust is a powerful construct that allows you to execute a block of code continuously as long as a condition is true. You can use it for a wide range of programming tasks, from counting to searching for data in a collection, among other things.
