Boolean in Rust represents truth values, which can either be true or false. Boolean values are represented using the `bool` type in Rust, and they play a very important role in programming as they help in the evaluation of logical expressions.

Here are some examples of how to use boolean in Rust:

1. To declare a variable of boolean type:

```rust
let x: bool = true;
let y: bool = false;
```

2. To declare a function that returns a boolean value:

```rust
fn is_even(num: i32) -> bool {
    if num % 2 == 0 {
        return true;
    } else {
        return false;
    }
}
```

3. To use boolean values in control flow statements:

```rust
let num = 5;
if num < 10 {
    println!("{} is less than 10", num);
} else {
    println!("{} is greater than or equal to 10", num);
}
```

4. To use boolean values in logical expressions:

```rust
let a = true;
let b = false;
println!("a AND b is {}", a && b);
println!("a OR b is {}", a || b);
println!("NOT a is {}", !a);
```

In these examples, the `&&` operator represents logical and, `||` represents logical or, and `!` represents logical not.

Using boolean values in Rust is simple and intuitive, and they can help make your programs more efficient and effective.
