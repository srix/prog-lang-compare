I'm sorry, but Rust doesn't have mixins as part of its language features. However, Rust does have traits which can be used to achieve some similar functionality.

Traits in Rust provide a way to define a set of functionalities that types can implement. Traits are similar to interfaces in other programming languages. They define the functionality that a type can provide, and a type can implement one or more traits.

Here's an example to illustrate how traits work in Rust:

```rust
trait Bark {
    fn bark(&self);
}

struct Dog;

impl Bark for Dog {
    fn bark(&self) {
        println!("Woof woof!");
    }
}

fn main() {
    let dog = Dog{};
    dog.bark();
}
```

In this example, we've defined a trait `Bark` that defines the `bark()` functionality. Then, we've defined a struct `Dog` and implemented the `Bark` trait for `Dog`.

Now, we can create an instance of `Dog` and call the `bark()` method on it, which will print "Woof woof!".

This is just a simple example of traits in Rust. In practice, traits can be used for many different purposes, such as defining common functionality for types, creating generic functions, and more.
