Sure, I'd be happy to help!

In Rust, arrays have a fixed size and are allocated on the stack. Therefore, elements cannot be added or removed from an array at runtime. However, you can remove an element from an array by creating a new array without the element you wish to remove.

Here's an example:

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
    let index_to_remove = 2;

    // Create a new array without the element to remove
    let mut new_arr = Vec::with_capacity(arr.len() - 1);
    new_arr.extend_from_slice(&arr[..index_to_remove]);
    new_arr.extend_from_slice(&arr[index_to_remove + 1..]);

    // Update the original array
    arr = new_arr.into_boxed_slice().into_inner().unwrap();

    println!("{:?}", arr); // Output: [1, 2, 4, 5]
}
```

In the example above, we first define an array `arr` with the elements `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`. We then specify the index of the element we wish to remove (`2`, which corresponds to `3`). 

To remove the element, we first create a new `Vec` without the element to remove. We do this by creating a new `Vec` with the same capacity as the original array and using the `extend_from_slice` method to add the elements before the index to remove and after the index to remove to the new `Vec`. 

We then use the `into_boxed_slice` method to convert the `Vec` to a boxed slice (an allocated array on the heap) and the `into_inner` method to unwrap the boxed slice and get the underlying array. We update the original array with this new array.

Finally, we print the new array to verify that the element at the specified index has been removed.

I hope that helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.
