In Rust 1.55, `and` and `or` operators are represented by `&&` and `||` respectively. Both operators are used for boolean expressions and return a boolean value.

`&&` (and operator) returns `true` if both operands are `true`, otherwise returns `false`. Here’s an example:

```rust
let a = true;
let b = false;
let c = true;

println!("{}", a && b); // Output: false
println!("{}", b && c); // Output: false
println!("{}", a && c); // Output: true
```

`||` (or operator) returns `true` if any one of the operands or both are `true`, and returns `false` if both operands are `false`. Here’s an example:

```rust
let a = true;
let b = false;
let c = true;

println!("{}", a || b); // Output: true
println!("{}", b || c); // Output: true
println!("{}", b || b); // Output: false
```

Additionally, the `and` and `or` operators can be used within conditional statements. For example:

```rust
let x = 10;
let y = 20;

if x > 5 && y < 25 {
    println!("Both conditions are true.");
}

if x > 15 || y < 18 {
    println!("At least one condition is true.");
}
```

In the first example, the code block will execute if `x` is greater than 5 and `y` is less than 25. In the second example, the code block will execute if `x` is greater than 15 or if `y` is less than 18.
