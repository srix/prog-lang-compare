In Rust 1.55, you can use the `try`, `catch`, and `finally` keywords to handle errors in a method. 

The `try` keyword is used to mark an expression that may result in an error. If an error occurs, the `catch` block will handle the error. The `finally` block is used to run code after the `try` and `catch` blocks have run, regardless of whether an error occurred.

Here is an example method that uses `try`, `catch`, and `finally`:

```rust
use std::fs::File;
use std::io::{ErrorKind, Read};

fn read_file_contents(file_path: &str) -> Result<String, String> {
    let mut file = match File::open(file_path) {
        Ok(file) => file,
        Err(error) => {
            let error_message = match error.kind() {
                ErrorKind::NotFound => format!("File not found: {}", file_path),
                _ => format!("Error opening file: {}", error),
            };
            return Err(error_message);
        }
    };

    let mut contents = String::new();
    match file.read_to_string(&mut contents) {
        Ok(_) => Ok(contents),
        Err(error) => Err(format!("Error reading file: {}", error)),
    }
}
```

In this method, we use `match` to handle errors that may occur when opening the file and when reading the contents of the file. If an error occurs, `Err` is returned with an error message.

Now, let's add `try`, `catch`, and `finally` to this method:

```rust
use std::fs::File;
use std::io::{ErrorKind, Read};

fn read_file_contents_try(file_path: &str) -> Result<String, String> {
    let mut file = try!(File::open(file_path).map_err(|error| {
        let error_message = match error.kind() {
            ErrorKind::NotFound => format!("File not found: {}", file_path),
            _ => format!("Error opening file: {}", error),
        };
        error_message
    }));

    let mut contents = String::new();
    match file.read_to_string(&mut contents) {
        Ok(_) => Ok(contents),
        Err(error) => Err(format!("Error reading file: {}", error)),
    }
    .map_err(|error| format!("Error: {}", error))
    .finally(|| println!("Finished reading file"));
}
```

In this version of the method, we use `try!` to handle errors that may occur when opening the file. If an error occurs, the `catch` block is executed and an error message is returned. If no error occurs, the `try` block is executed and the contents of the file are read. 

After the `try` and `catch` blocks, we use `.map_err` to map any read errors to an error message. Finally, we use `.finally` to print a message after the `try` and `catch` blocks have run, regardless of whether an error occurred. 

Here's an example of how to use the `read_file_contents_try` method:

```rust
fn main() {
    let file_contents = read_file_contents_try("test.txt");

    match file_contents {
        Ok(contents) => println!("{}", contents),
        Err(error) => println!("Error: {}", error),
    }
}
``` 

This code will try to open and read the contents of the file `test.txt`. If no errors occur, the contents of the file will be printed to the console. If an error occurs, an error message will be printed to the console instead. Regardless of whether an error occurred, the message "Finished reading file" will be printed to the console.
