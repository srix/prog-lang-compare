In Rust 1.55, you can read a file using the standard library's `fs` module and the `File` struct. There are a few different ways to read a file, depending on your needs. Here are some examples:

1. Reading the entire contents of a file into a string:

```rust
use std::fs;

fn main() -> std::io::Result<()> {
    let contents = fs::read_to_string("file.txt")?;
    println!("{}", contents);
    Ok(())
}
```

This code reads the contents of the file "file.txt" into a string named `contents`, and then prints the string to the console. The `read_to_string` function returns a `Result` object, which we are handling using the `?` operator to propagate any errors.

2. Reading the contents of a file line by line:

```rust
use std::fs::File;
use std::io::{BufRead, BufReader};

fn main() -> std::io::Result<()> {
    let file = File::open("file.txt")?;
    let reader = BufReader::new(file);

    for line in reader.lines() {
        println!("{}", line?);
    }

    Ok(())
}
```

This code opens the file "file.txt" using the `File::open` function and creates a `BufReader` object to read the file line by line. The `lines` function returns an iterator over the lines of the file, and we loop over each line and print it to the console. Note that the `line?` syntax is used to propagate any errors that might occur while reading the file.

3. Reading the contents of a file into a byte buffer:

```rust
use std::fs::File;
use std::io::{Read};

fn main() -> std::io::Result<()> {
    let mut buffer = [0; 1024];
    let mut file = File::open("file.txt")?;

    // read up to 1024 bytes and return the number of bytes read
    let bytes_read = file.read(&mut buffer)?;

    // print the byte buffer as a string
    println!("{}", String::from_utf8_lossy(&buffer[..bytes_read]));

    Ok(())
}
```

This code reads up to 1024 bytes of the file "file.txt" into a byte buffer named `buffer`, using the `Read` trait's `read` method. The `read` method returns the number of bytes that were actually read, so we pass this value to `from_utf8_lossy` to convert the byte buffer to a string. Note that we are using a mutable reference to `file` and `buffer`, since we need to modify them to read data.
