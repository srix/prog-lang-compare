In Rust, `try`, `catch`, and `finally` are not keywords. Instead, Rust uses the `Result` type, which can represent either a success or a failure. When a function returns a `Result`, you can use the `match` expression to check whether the result is successful (`Ok`) or a failure (`Err`). 

Here is an example of how to use `Result` and `match` in a function that may produce an error:

```rust
fn divide(x: i32, y: i32) -> Result<i32, String> {
    if y == 0 {
        return Err("Division by zero error".to_string());
    }
    Ok(x / y)
}

fn main() {
    let result = divide(10, 0);
    match result {
        Ok(value) => println!("Result: {}", value),
        Err(error) => println!("Error: {}", error),
    }
}
```

In the above example, the `divide` function takes two `i32` arguments and returns a `Result<i32, String>` type. If the second argument is zero, the function returns an `Err` with a message. Otherwise, the function returns the result of dividing `x` by `y` as an `Ok` value. 

In the `main` function, we call `divide(10, 0)` and store the result in the `result` variable. We then use the `match` expression to handle the `Result`. If the result is `Ok`, we print the value using `println!`. If the result is `Err`, we print the error message using `println!`.

If you want to perform some action regardless of whether an error occurs or not, you can use the `?` operator or the `match` expression in a `finally` block-like function called `finally` from the `ScopeGuard` crate, like so:

```rust
use scopeguard::ScopeGuard;

let mut x = 0;
let scope_guard = ScopeGuard::defer(|| {
   println!("Scope guard reached");
   x = 1;
});

let result = divide(10, 0)?;
scope_guard.run_unwind(); // finally block

match result {
    Ok(value) => println!("Result: {}", value),
    Err(error) => println!("Error: {}", error),
}

println!("X value: {}", x); // X value: 1
```

In this example, we're using a scope guard to reach the `finally` block. The `defer` function creates a `ScopeGuard` object that executes the closure passed as an argument when it goes out of scope, which is when the `finally` block is reached. In this case, we set `x` to 1 inside the closure.

To use the `finally` block-like function provided by `ScopeGuard`, we call the `run_unwind` method on the `ScopeGuard` object wherever we want the block to be executed, which, in this case, is after the `match` expression in the example above.
