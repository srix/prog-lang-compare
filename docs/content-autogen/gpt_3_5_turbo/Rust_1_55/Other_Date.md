Sure, I'd be happy to help you with that. Rust provides the `chrono` crate for parsing, formatting, and manipulating dates and times. Here's how you can use it in Rust 1.55.

First, add `chrono` to your `Cargo.toml` file as a dependency:

```toml
[dependencies]
chrono = "0.4"
```

Then, you can use the `DateTime` type to represent a specific date and time. Here's an example:

```rust
use chrono::{DateTime, Local};

fn main() {
    let now: DateTime<Local> = Local::now();
    println!("Current time is: {}", now);
}
```

This will print the current date and time using the local timezone.

You can also use the `parse_from_str` method to parse a date and time from a string:

```rust
use chrono::{DateTime, Local, TimeZone};

fn main() {
    let date_str = "2021-09-23 14:25:00";
    let date_time = Local
        .datetime_from_str(date_str, "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")
        .expect("Failed to parse date and time");

    println!("Parsed date and time: {}", date_time);
}
```

This will parse the string "2021-09-23 14:25:00" using the format string "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S" and print the resulting `DateTime<Local>` object.

You can also format a `DateTime` object into a string using the `format` method:

```rust
use chrono::{DateTime, Local, TimeZone};

fn main() {
    let now: DateTime<Local> = Local::now();
    let formatted_date_str = now.format("%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S");
    println!("Formatted date and time: {}", formatted_date_str);
}
```

This will print the current date and time in the format "YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS".

These are just a few examples of using the `chrono` crate in Rust 1.55. `chrono` provides many other useful functions and types for working with dates and times, so I suggest checking out its documentation for more information.
