In Rust, `unless` is not a direct keyword like it is in some other programming languages. However, you can simulate the `unless` behavior using the `if` keyword and a logical negation (`!`). 

Here's an example that demonstrates how to use `unless` using this technique:

```rust
let x = 5;

if !(x > 10) {
    println!("x is less than or equal to 10");
}
```

In this example, the logical negation `!(x > 10)` evaluates to `true` because `x` is not greater than `10`. Therefore, the code inside the `if` block executes and the output is `x is less than or equal to 10`.

You can also use the `else` keyword to specify what should happen if the condition evaluates to `false`. Here's an example:

```rust
let x = 5;

if !(x > 10) {
    println!("x is less than or equal to 10");
} else {
    println!("x is greater than 10");
}
```

In this example, because `x` is less than `10`, the code inside the `if` block executes and the output is `x is less than or equal to 10`.

So, using the logical negation `!` with the `if` keyword allows you to simulate the behavior of `unless` in Rust.
