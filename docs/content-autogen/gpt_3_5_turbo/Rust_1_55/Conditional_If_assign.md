In Rust, `if let` syntax is used for conditional binding. It allows us to unpack a single item from a pattern, and if the pattern does not match, the code block will not execute.

Syntax for `if let`:

```rust
if let pattern = expression {
    // code to execute if pattern matches expression
}
```

Here is an example that demonstrates the use of `if let`:

```rust
fn main() {
    let x = Some(5);
    let y = None;
    
    // use if let to check if the value of x is Some
    if let Some(num) = x {
        println!("x: {}", num);
    }
    else {
        println!("x is None");
    }
    
    // use if let to check if the value of y is Some
    if let Some(num) = y {
        println!("y: {}", num);
    }
    else {
        println!("y is None");
    }
}
```

Output:

```
x: 5
y is None
```

In the above example, the first `if let` block executes because `x` contains a `Some` value. The second `if let` block does not execute because `y` is `None`.

`if let` can also be used to destructure tuples and enums. Here is an example:

```rust
enum Color {
    Red,
    Green,
    Blue,
}

fn main() {
    let color = Color::Green;
    
    // use if let to match against the Green variant
    if let Color::Green = color {
        println!("color is Green");
    }
    else {
        println!("color is not Green");
    }
}
```

Output:

```
color is Green
```

In the above example, `if let` is used to match against the `Green` variant of the `Color` enum. If the `color` variable contains the `Green` variant, the first code block will execute, otherwise the second code block will execute.
