To split a string in TypeScript, you can use the `split()` method which returns an array containing the substrings generated by splitting the original string using the specified separator. Here's an example:

```typescript
let myString = "Hello, world!";
let myArray = myString.split(", "); // split the string at the comma and space
console.log(myArray); // Output: ["Hello", "world!"]
```

In the example above, `split()` method splits the string into two substrings at the comma and space, and returns them as an array. The resulting array contains the substrings `"Hello"` and `"world!"`.

You can also split a string based on a regular expression. Here's an example:

```typescript
let myString = "watermelon, apple, banana, pear";
let myArray = myString.split(/,\s+/); // split the string at each comma followed by one or more spaces
console.log(myArray); // Output: ["watermelon", "apple", "banana", "pear"]
```

In this example, `split()` method splits the string using the regular expression `/,\\s+/`, which matches each comma followed by one or more spaces. The resulting array contains the substrings `"watermelon"`, `"apple"`, `"banana"`, and `"pear"`.
