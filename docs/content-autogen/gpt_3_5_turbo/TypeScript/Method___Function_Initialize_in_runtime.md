To initialize a method or function at runtime in TypeScript, we can use the `Function` constructor. This constructor takes a string of code as its parameter and returns a new function object that executes the code.

Here is an example of initializing a function at runtime using the `Function` constructor:

```typescript
const add = new Function('a', 'b', 'return a + b');
console.log(add(2, 3)); // Output: 5
```

This code creates a new function called `add` by passing a string of code to the `Function` constructor, which takes two arguments `a` and `b` and returns their sum.

We can also pass an entire function body as a string to the `Function` constructor, like this:

```typescript
const multiply = new Function('a', 'b', 'return a * b;');
console.log(multiply(2, 3)); // Output: 6
```

In this example, we create a new function called `multiply` that takes two arguments `a` and `b` and returns their product.

Note that using the `Function` constructor to create functions at runtime can be risky because it can execute arbitrary code. We should only use it when necessary and with caution.
