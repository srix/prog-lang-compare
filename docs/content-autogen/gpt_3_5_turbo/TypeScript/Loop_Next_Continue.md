In TypeScript, the `next` and `continue` statements are used to control loops. Here's a brief explanation of how to use them:

1. `next` statement: It skips the current iteration of a loop and moves to the next iteration.

Example:

```
for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  if (i === 2) {
    console.log("Skipping iteration: " + i);
    continue; // Skips iteration 2
  }
  console.log("Iteration " + i);
}
```

Output:

```
Iteration 0
Iteration 1
Skipping iteration: 2
Iteration 3
Iteration 4
```

2. `continue` statement: It is similar to `next` statement but instead of skipping the current iteration, it jumps to the end of the loop and starts the next iteration.

Example:

```
for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  if (i === 2) {
    console.log("Continuing loop..."); // Skips iteration 2
    continue;
  }
  console.log("Iteration " + i);
}
```

Output:

```
Iteration 0
Iteration 1
Continuing loop...
Iteration 3
Iteration 4
```

I hope this helps!
