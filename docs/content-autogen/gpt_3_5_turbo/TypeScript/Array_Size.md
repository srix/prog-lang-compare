You can get the size of an array in TypeScript by using the `length` property. The `length` property returns the number of elements in the array.

Here is an example:

```typescript
let numbers: number[] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
console.log(numbers.length); // Output: 5
```

In the example above, we have an array of 5 numbers. We use the `length` property to get the size of the array which is 5.

You can also get the size of a string using the `length` property. Here is an example:

```typescript
let name: string = "John";
console.log(name.length); // Output: 4
```

In the example above, we have a string with 4 characters. We use the `length` property to get the size of the string which is 4.
