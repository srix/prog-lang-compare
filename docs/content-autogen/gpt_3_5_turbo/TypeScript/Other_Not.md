In TypeScript (and many other programming languages), the keyword `not` can be used as a logical negation operator to reverse the boolean value of an expression. 

Here's an example:

```typescript
let x: boolean = false;
let y: boolean = !x; // y will be true
```

In this example, the `!` operator is used to negate the value of `x`, resulting in `y` being assigned `true`.

In TypeScript, you can also use the `not` keyword as part of type guards. Consider the following example:

```typescript
interface Dog {
  name: string;
  breed: string;
}

function isDog(animal: unknown): animal is Dog {
  return (animal as Dog).breed !== undefined;
}

let myPet: unknown = {name: 'Buddy', breed: 'Golden Retriever'};

if (!isDog(myPet)) {
  console.log("That's not a dog!");
} else {
  console.log("Hello, " + myPet.name);
}
```

In this example, the function `isDog` is a type guard which checks if an object `animal` has a property called `breed`. We can use the `not` keyword to negate this type guard when checking the type of `myPet`. If `myPet` is not a `Dog`, the program will log `"That's not a dog!"`. Otherwise, it will log `"Hello, " + myPet.name`.
