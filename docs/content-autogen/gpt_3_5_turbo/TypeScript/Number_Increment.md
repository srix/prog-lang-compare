In TypeScript, you can increment a number using the ++ operator.

Here's an example:

```typescript
let num: number = 5;
num++; // num is now 6
```

In this example, we first define a variable `num` with the value of 5. Then, we use the ++ operator to increment `num` by 1. Afterwards, `num` is now equal to 6.

You can also use the ++ operator before the variable name. Here's an example:

```typescript
let num: number = 5;
++num; // num is now 6
```

This produces the same result as the previous example. By using ++ before the variable name, we first increment `num` by 1 and then assign the new value to the same variable.
