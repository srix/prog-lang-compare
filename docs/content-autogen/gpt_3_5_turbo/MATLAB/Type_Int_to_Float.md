Sure, I would be happy to help you with that!

In MATLAB, converting an integer to a float can be done by simply dividing the integer by a floating-point number. 

Here's an example code snippet that demonstrates converting the integer value "5" to a floating-point value:

```
x = 5;
y = x / 1.0;
```

In this example, we declare the integer value "5" as `x`. Then, we divide `x` by `1.0`, which is a floating-point number. The result is a floating-point value, which we assign to the variable `y`.

Another way to convert an integer to a float in MATLAB is to use the `double()` function, as shown in the following example:

```
x = 10;
y = double(x);
```

In this code snippet, we declare the integer value "10" as `x`. Then, we use the `double()` function to convert `x` to a floating-point value, which we assign to the variable `y`.

I hope this helps. Let me know if you have any questions!
