Sure, here's an overview of how to run a command in MATLAB with some examples:

1. Open MATLAB and create a new script file (.m) or type directly into the Command Window.

2. Type the name of the command followed by the input values in parentheses. For example, to use the "disp" command to display a message, type:

```
disp('Hello, world!')
```

This will display the message "Hello, world!" in the Command Window.

3. You can also use mathematical operations as commands. For example, to add two numbers together, type:

```
3 + 4
```

This will return the value 7 in the Command Window.

4. To store the result of a command in a variable, use the assignment operator (=). For example, to store the sum of two numbers in a variable "sum", type:

```
sum = 3 + 4
```

This will assign the value 7 to the variable "sum".

5. You can also run built-in MATLAB functions, such as "sqrt" (square root) or "sin" (sine). For example, to calculate the square root of a number, type:

```
sqrt(16)
```

This will return the value 4 in the Command Window.

These are just a few examples of how to run a command in MATLAB. There are many more commands and functions available in MATLAB, so be sure to reference the MATLAB documentation for more information.
