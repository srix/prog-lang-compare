In MATLAB, you can increment a number using the addition operator `+`. Here are some examples:

1. Incrementing a number by 1:
```
a = 10;
a = a + 1;
disp(a); % output: 11
```

2. Incrementing a number by a different value:
```
b = 5;
b = b + 3;
disp(b); % output: 8
```

3. Using the shortcut `++` operator to increment a number by 1:
```
c = 7;
c++;
disp(c); % output: 8
``` 

Note that you can also use the `+=` operator to perform the same task, like this:

```
d = 15;
d += 2;
disp(d); % output: 17
``` 

All of these examples show how to increment a number in MATLAB.
