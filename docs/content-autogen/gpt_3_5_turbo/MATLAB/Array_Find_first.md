Sure, here's how to find the first element of an array in MATLAB:

To find the first element of an array, you can use the indexing operator (`[]`) with an index of 1. 

Here's an example code snippet that demonstrates this:

```matlab
% create an example array
myArray = [3 5 7 9];

% find the first element of the array using indexing
firstElement = myArray(1);

% display the first element
disp(firstElement);
```

Output:
```
3
```
In this example, we created an array `[3 5 7 9]` and used the indexing operator to find the first element of the array, which is `3`.
