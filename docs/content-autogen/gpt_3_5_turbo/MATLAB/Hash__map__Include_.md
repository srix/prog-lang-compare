In MATLAB, you can check if a hash includes a key using the function called `isKey()`. The `isKey()` function takes two arguments: the first argument is the hash object, and the second argument is the key you want to check.

Here's an example:

```
% Define a hash with several key-value pairs
myHash = containers.Map();
myHash('John') = 25;
myHash('Mary') = 30;
myHash('Mike') = 35;

% Check if the hash includes the key 'Mary'
if isKey(myHash, 'Mary')
    fprintf('The hash includes the key ''Mary''.\n')
else
    fprintf('The hash does not include the key ''Mary''.\n')
end

% Check if the hash includes the key 'Alice'
if isKey(myHash, 'Alice')
    fprintf('The hash includes the key ''Alice''.\n')
else
    fprintf('The hash does not include the key ''Alice''.\n')
end
```

The output of this code will be:

```
The hash includes the key 'Mary'.
The hash does not include the key 'Alice'.
```

As you can see, the `isKey()` function returns `true` if the hash includes the key you are checking, and `false` otherwise.
