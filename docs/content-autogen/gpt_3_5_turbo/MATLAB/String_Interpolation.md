Interpolating strings in MATLAB is the process of constructing new strings based on a template string and a set of variables that are substituted into the template string. Here is an example of how to interpolate strings in MATLAB:

Suppose we have two variables, `name` and `age`, and we want to create a string that says "My name is (name) and I am (age) years old." We can do this using interpolation in MATLAB as follows:

```matlab
name = 'John';
age = 25;
str = sprintf('My name is %s and I am %d years old.', name, age);
disp(str);
```

This will output the following string:

```
My name is John and I am 25 years old.
```

In this example, the `%s` and `%d` placeholders are used to indicate where the values of `name` and `age` should be inserted in the template string. The `sprintf` function is used to perform the interpolation and create a new string.

Another way to interpolate strings in MATLAB is to use the curly brace notation `{}`. Here is an example of how to do this:

```matlab
name = 'John';
age = 25;
str = ['My name is ', name, ' and I am ', num2str(age), ' years old.'];
disp(str);
```

This will output the same string as before:

```
My name is John and I am 25 years old.
```

In this example, the variables `name` and `age` are concatenated using the square bracket notation `[]`. The `num2str` function is used to convert the numeric value of `age` to a string so that it can be concatenated with the other string elements. The curly brace notation `{}` is used to insert the values of `name` and `age` into the template string.
