To get the maximum or minimum value between two numbers in MATLAB, you can use the built-in functions 'max' and 'min'.

Example 1: Finding the maximum value:

```matlab
a = 10;
b = 15;
max_value = max(a, b);

disp(max_value); % Output: 15
```

Example 2: Finding the minimum value:

```matlab
c = 20;
d = 5;
min_value = min(c, d);

disp(min_value); % Output: 5
```

In both examples, we first defined two variables 'a' and 'b' (or 'c' and 'd') with the values we want to compare. Then, we used the appropriate function ('max' for the first example, 'min' for the second) with the two variables as inputs. The resulting maximum or minimum value was then assigned to a new variable ('max_value' or 'min_value'). Finally, we printed the value to the screen with the 'disp' function.
