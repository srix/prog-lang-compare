In MATLAB, "this or that" can be assigned based on certain conditions using logical operators. 

For example, suppose you want to assign a value of 1 if a certain variable (let's call it "x") is greater than 5 and a value of 0 if it is less than or equal to 5. You can use the following syntax:

```
if x > 5
    this_or_that = 1;
else
    this_or_that = 0;
end
```

Alternatively, you could use the ternary operator in MATLAB to achieve the same thing in a more concise way:

```
this_or_that = (x > 5) ? 1 : 0;
```

This assigns a value of 1 to `this_or_that` if the condition `(x > 5)` is true, and a value of 0 if it is false. 

Other logical operators that can be used for "this or that" assignments in MATLAB include:

- `&&` (logical AND) and `||` (logical OR)
- `&` (element-wise AND) and `|` (element-wise OR)

For example, suppose you have two variables, `a` and `b`, and you want to assign a value of "high" if both are greater than 10, a value of "medium" if either one of them is greater than 5, and a value of "low" otherwise. You can use the following code:

```
if (a > 10) && (b > 10)
    this_or_that = "high";
elseif (a > 5) || (b > 5)
    this_or_that = "medium";
else
    this_or_that = "low";
end
```

Alternatively, you could use the element-wise operators `&` and `|` to achieve the same thing with arrays of values:

```
a = [9, 12, 7, 15];
b = [11, 13, 4, 8];
this_or_that = strings(size(a));

this_or_that((a > 10) & (b > 10)) = "high";
this_or_that((a > 5) | (b > 5)) = "medium";
this_or_that(~((a > 10) & (b > 10)) & ~((a > 5) | (b > 5))) = "low";
```

This assigns the appropriate value to each element of the `this_or_that` array based on the conditions specified.
