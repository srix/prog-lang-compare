In MATLAB, a closure is a function that can access and manipulate variables defined outside of its own scope. A closure is created by defining a function within another function (the enclosing function). 

Here's an example that uses closures in MATLAB:

```matlab
function main()
    x = 5;
    y = 10;
    f = createFunction();
    output = f(x);
    fprintf('The result is %f\n', output);
end

function output = createFunction()
    y = 20;
    f = @innerFunction;
    
    function result = innerFunction(input)
        result = x * y + input;
    end

    output = f;
end
```

In this example, the `createFunction()` function creates and returns the `innerFunction()` closure, which takes an input and returns a result based on the values of `x` and `y`.

The `x` and `y` variables are defined outside of the `innerFunction()` scope, but can be accessed because they are defined in the parent scope of `createFunction()`.

When `main()` calls `createFunction()`, it returns the `innerFunction()` closure, which is assigned to `f`. The resulting function is then called with `x` as the input, which returns the result of `x * y + input`.

The output of running this code would be:

```
The result is 75.000000
```

This example demonstrates how closures can be useful in encapsulating and manipulating variables within a function.
