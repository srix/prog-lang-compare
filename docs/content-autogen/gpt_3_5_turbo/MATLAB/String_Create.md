Sure, creating a string in MATLAB is simple. To create a string, enclose the characters of the string in either single quotes (`' '`) or double quotes (`" "`), like so:

```
myString1 = 'Hello World';
myString2 = "Hello MATLAB";
```

Both `myString1` and `myString2` are string variables containing the strings "Hello World" and "Hello MATLAB" respectively.

Here are a few more examples of creating strings in MATLAB:

```
% empty string
emptyString = '';

% string with newline character
newLineString = 'Hello\nWorld';

% string with double quotes
doubleQuotesString = "I said, ""Hello!""";
```

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any more questions.
