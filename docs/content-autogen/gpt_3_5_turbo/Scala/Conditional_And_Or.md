In Scala, `and` and `or` are represented by the keywords `&&` and `||`, respectively. The `&&` operator returns `true` if both the conditions are true, otherwise it returns `false`. The `||` operator returns `true` if at least one of the conditions is true, otherwise it returns `false`.

Here is an example of using `&&`:

```
val x = 5
val y = 10
if (x > 0 && y > 0) {
  println("Both x and y are positive")
}
```

In this example, the `&&` operator is used to check if both `x` and `y` are positive. If both are positive, then the message "Both x and y are positive" will be printed.

Here is an example of using `||`:

```
val x = 5
val y = -5
if (x > 0 || y > 0) {
  println("At least one of x and y is positive")
}
```

In this example, the `||` operator is used to check if either `x` or `y` is positive. Since `x` is positive, the message "At least one of x and y is positive" will be printed.
