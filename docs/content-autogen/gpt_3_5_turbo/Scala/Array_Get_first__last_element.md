In Scala, the first and last element of an array can be obtained using the `head` and `last` methods respectively. Here's an example:

```
val nums = Array(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)

// To get the first element
val first = nums.head
println(first) // Output: 1

// To get the last element
val last = nums.last
println(last) // Output: 5
```

In the above example, we have an array `nums` containing five elements. To get the first element, we use the `head` method. Similarly, to get the last element, we use the `last` method. Both methods return the corresponding element of the array.
