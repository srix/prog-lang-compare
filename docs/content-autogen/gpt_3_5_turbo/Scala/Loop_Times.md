In Scala, the `*` symbol represents multiplication, and you can use it to perform times operation.

Here are some examples of using times in Scala:

1. Multiplying two numbers:
```scala
val a = 5
val b = 3
val c = a * b // result 15
```

2. Printing a message multiple times using a for-loop:
```scala
for(i <- 1 to 5) {
  println("Hello World!")
}
```
Output:
```
Hello World!
Hello World!
Hello World!
Hello World!
Hello World!
```

3. Creating an array with a specified number of elements:
```scala
val arr = Array.fill(5)(0)
// Output: [0,0,0,0,0]
```

4. Repeating a string multiple times:
```scala
val str = "Scala Rocks!" * 3
// Output: "Scala Rocks!Scala Rocks!Scala Rocks!"
```

In Scala, times operation can be performed with both numbers and strings. You can also use for-loops, arrays and other features to work with times.
