Sure, I'd be happy to explain it!

In Scala, you can convert an integer to a float by simply appending a decimal point with a zero as a fractional part (e.g. ".0") to the integer. This is because the compiler recognizes this pattern as a floating point number.

Here is an example of how to convert an integer to a float:

```scala
val intNumber = 10
val floatNumber = intNumber.toFloat
```

In this example, we create an integer variable called `intNumber` with a value of 10. We then use the `toFloat` method to convert this integer to a float and assign it to a new variable called `floatNumber`.

We can also use the decimal point method mentioned above to directly convert an integer to a float without using the `toFloat` method. Here's an example:

```scala
val intNumber = 10
val floatNumber = intNumber + .0
```

In this example, we add a decimal point with a zero value to the integer using the `+` operator, which automatically converts the result to a float.

I hope that helps!
