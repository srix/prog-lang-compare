In Scala, you can use single-line or multi-line comments to explain code and make it more readable for others. 

Single-line comments start with two forward slashes `//` and continue until the end of the line. For example: 

```scala
// This is a single-line comment in Scala
val age = 28 // This is also a single-line comment, but it's at the end of a line of code
```

Multi-line comments start with `/*` and end with `*/`. For example:

```scala
/*
This is a multi-line comment
You can write as many lines as you want in here
*/
val name = "John"
```

It is also possible to nest comment blocks, like this:

```scala
/* This is a comment /* with a nested comment */ done! */
```

However, it is not recommended to write nested comments as it can make the code very difficult to read.

It is important to use comments in your code to make it more understandable and maintainable to others.
