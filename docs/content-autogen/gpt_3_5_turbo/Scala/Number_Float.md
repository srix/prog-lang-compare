In Scala, float numbers are represented by the "Float" data type. Float is a 32-bit floating-point data type that supports both positive and negative decimal numbers with up to seven significant digits. Here is an example of how to use float numbers in Scala:

```scala
// Assigning a float value to a variable
val floatNum: Float = 3.14159f

// Printing the value of a float variable
println(floatNum)

// Using float with mathematical operations
val result = 5.0f + 2.5f
println(result) // Output: 7.5
```

In the above example, we have created a float variable named `floatNum`, assigned it a value of `3.14159f`, and printed it using the `println()` method. We have also shown how to use float numbers in mathematical operations by adding two float numbers together and storing the result in a variable named `result`. The syntax for float numbers is very similar to double numbers, but with the addition of a "f" at the end of the number to indicate that it is a float.
