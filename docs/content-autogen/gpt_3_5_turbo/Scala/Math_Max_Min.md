In Scala, we can find the maximum and minimum of two numbers using the max() and min() methods respectively. Here are the examples:

```
// finding the maximum of two numbers
val a = 5
val b = 10
val max = a.max(b)
println("The maximum of " + a + " and " + b + " is " + max)

// Output: The maximum of 5 and 10 is 10

// finding the minimum of two numbers
val num1 = 250
val num2 = 350
val min = num1.min(num2)
println("The minimum of " + num1 + " and " + num2 + " is " + min)

// Output: The minimum of 250 and 350 is 250
```

In the first example, we have defined two numbers `a` and `b`. We then use the max() method to find the maximum of these two numbers and store the result in a variable `max`, which is then printed to the console.

In the second example, we have defined two numbers `num1` and `num2`. We then use the min() method to find the minimum of these two numbers and store the result in a variable `min`, which is then printed to the console.
