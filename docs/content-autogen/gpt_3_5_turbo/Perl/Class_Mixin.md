In Perl, a mixin is a Perl module that provides methods that can be used by other classes or modules without inheritance. It is used to add functionality to a class without the need for inheritance.

Here is an example of how to create a simple mixin:

```perl
package MyMixin;

use strict;
use warnings;

sub func1 {
    my $self = shift;
    print "func1: This is my mixin function.\n";
}
```

This is a module called MyMixin that provides a function named func1.

Now, to use this mixin in another module or class, you can use the "use base" or "use parent" statements to import the mixin's functions:

```perl
package MyClass;

use strict;
use warnings;
use parent qw(MyMixin);

sub new {
    my $self = bless {}, shift;
    return $self;
}

sub func2 {
    my $self = shift;
    $self->func1();
    print "func2: This is my class function.\n";
}
```

In this example, we created a class called MyClass that inherits from MyMixin using the "use parent" statement. The new() method creates an instance of MyClass, and the func2() method calls the mixin method (func1()) as well as a custom class method.

Now you can create an instance of MyClass and call its methods, including the mixin function:

```perl
my $object = MyClass->new();
$object->func1();
$object->func2();
```

When you run this code, it will output:

```
func1: This is my mixin function.
func1: This is my mixin function.
func2: This is my class function.
```

This shows how the mixin function func1() can be called from both the mixin module and the MyClass module.
