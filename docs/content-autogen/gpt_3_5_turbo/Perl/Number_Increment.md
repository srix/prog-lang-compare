In Perl, the increment operator `++` can be used to increment a number by one.

Here are some examples:

```
my $number = 5;

$number++; # increments $number by 1

print $number; # output: 6

$number += 3; # increments $number by 3

print $number; # output: 9
```

In the above example, the variable `$number` is initially set to 5. The `++` operator is then used to increment the value of `$number` by 1. The resulting value of `$number` is then printed to the screen.

In the second example, the `+=` operator is used instead of `++` to increment the value of `$number` by 3. The resulting value of `$number` is then printed to the screen.
