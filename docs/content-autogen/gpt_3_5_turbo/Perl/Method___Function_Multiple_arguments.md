In Perl, you can pass multiple arguments or parameters to a function or method. To do so, you simply include the additional arguments in the function call.

Here is an example of a function that takes two arguments in Perl:

```
sub multiply {
    my ($num1, $num2) = @_;
    my $result = $num1 * $num2;
    return $result;
}

my $product = multiply(5, 10);
print "The product is $product\n";
```

In this example, the `multiply` function takes two arguments `$num1` and `$num2` which are stored in an array reference `@_`. The function calculates the product of these two arguments and returns it.

To call the `multiply` function, we pass in two values `5` and `10`. The function then multiplies these two values and returns the product which is stored in the `$product` variable. Finally, we print the value of `$product` which is `50`.

You can pass any number of arguments to a Perl function or method by including them in the function call. Here's an example of a function that takes three arguments:

```
sub calculate_sum {
    my ($num1, $num2, $num3) = @_;
    my $sum = $num1 + $num2 + $num3;
    return $sum;
}

my $total = calculate_sum(10, 20, 30);
print "The total is $total\n";
```

In this example, the `calculate_sum` function takes three arguments `$num1`, `$num2`, and `$num3`, and calculates their sum. We call the function with three values `10`, `20`, and `30`. The function calculates their sum and returns it, which is stored in the `$total` variable. Finally, we print the value of `$total` which is `60`.

Hope this helps!
