{"Datatypes_Primitives": "In Haskell, primitive types are the most basic types that are built into the language and do not require any special libraries to be used. These types include:\n\n1. Int - represents integers, which are whole numbers without decimal points. It can be positive, negative, or zero.\n\nExample: \n\n```\nx :: Int\nx = 5\n```\n\n2. Integer - represents arbitrary-precision integers, which can be as large as the memory of the computer can accommodate.\n\nExample:\n\n```\ny :: Integer\ny = 123456789012345678901234567890\n```\n\n3. Float - represents floating-point numbers, which are numbers with a decimal point.\n\nExample:\n\n```\nz :: Float\nz = 3.14\n```\n\n4. Double - represents double-precision floating-point numbers, which are floating-point numbers with higher precision than Float.\n\nExample:\n\n```\na :: Double\na = 3.14159265359\n```\n\n5. Char - represents characters, which can be any character from the Unicode character set.\n\nExample:\n\n```\nb :: Char\nb = 'a'\n```\n\n6. Bool - represents Boolean values, which can be True or False.\n\nExample:\n\n```\nc :: Bool\nc = True\n```\n\nOverall, primitive types are the building blocks of Haskell programming and are used to create more complex types and structures.\n", "String_Create": "In Haskell, a string is a list of characters. We can create a string in Haskell using double quotes (\") or single quotes ('). Here are a few examples:\n\nUsing Double Quotes:\n\nWe can create a string using double quotes. For example:\n\n```\nmyString1 = \"Hello, World!\"\n```\n\nUsing Single Quotes:\n\nWe can create a string using single quotes too. For example:\n\n```\nmyString2 = 'Haskell is awesome!'\n```\n\nUsing List of Characters:\n\nAs a string is a list of characters in Haskell, we can simply define a list of characters as a string. For example:\n\n```\nmyString3 = ['H', 'a', 's', 'k', 'e', 'l', 'l']\n```\n\nIn Haskell, these three examples are equivalent and we can perform string operations on them in the same way.", "String_Concatenation": "In Haskell, there are different ways to concatenate strings.\n\nOne way is to use the `++` operator. The `++` operator is used to append two strings together to form a new string. Here's an example:\n\n```haskell\nconcatenateString :: String -> String -> String\nconcatenateString s1 s2 = s1 ++ s2\n\nmain = do\n   let str1 = \"Hello \"\n       str2 = \"World!\"\n   putStrLn (concatenateString str1 str2)\n   -- Output will be \"Hello World!\"\n```\n\nIn this example, we define a function named `concatenateString` that takes two `String` arguments, `s1` and `s2`. We then use the `++` operator to concatenate `s1` and `s2` together to form a new string.\n\nAnother way to concatenate strings is by using the `concat` function. The `concat` function takes a list of strings and concatenates them together into a single string. Here's an example:\n\n```haskell\nconcatenateList :: [String] -> String\nconcatenateList sList = concat sList\n\nmain = do\n   let sList = [\"Hello \", \"World!\"]\n   putStrLn (concatenateList sList)\n   -- Output will be \"Hello World!\"\n```\n\nIn this example, we define a function named `concatenateList` that takes a list of `String` arguments, `sList`. We then use the `concat` function to concatenate all the elements in `sList` together to form a new string.\n", "String_Interpolation": "In Haskell, string interpolation can be achieved using the `printf` function. This function takes a format string as its first argument and one or more values to be formatted as its subsequent arguments. The format string includes placeholders that are replaced by the corresponding values. \n\nHere's an example of how to use `printf` to interpolate strings:\n\n```\nimport Text.Printf\n\nname = \"Alice\"\nage = 30\n\ngreeting = printf \"Hello, my name is %s and I am %d years old.\" name age\n-- Result: \"Hello, my name is Alice and I am 30 years old.\"\n```\n\nIn the example above, we defined a `name` and `age` variable, and used them to create a formatted string using `printf`. The `%s` placeholder in the format string is replaced by the `name` variable, and the `%d` placeholder is replaced by the `age` variable.\n\nYou can use other placeholders with different data types as well. Here are some examples:\n\n```\npiValue = 3.14159\nformattedPi = printf \"The value of pi is approximately %.2f.\" piValue\n-- Result: \"The value of pi is approximately 3.14.\"\n\nisTrue = True\nformattedBool = printf \"The value of the boolean is %s.\" (show isTrue)\n-- Result: \"The value of the boolean is True.\"\n```\n\nIn the example above, we used the `%f` placeholder to format a floating-point value to two decimal places, and the `%s` placeholder to format a boolean value as a string using the `show` function.", "String_Remove_part": "In Haskell, you can remove a part of a string using the `Data.List` module. There are several functions available in this module that allow you to manipulate strings. One function that can be used to remove part of a string is `delete`.\n\nThe `delete` function removes the first occurrence of a substring from a string. Here's an example:\n\n```\nimport Data.List\n\nremoveString :: String -> String\nremoveString str = delete \"world\" str\n\nmain = do\n  let str = \"hello world\"\n  putStrLn (removeString str)\n```\n\nIn this example, the `removeString` function removes the substring \"world\" from the given string using the `delete` function. The output of this program will be \"hello \".\n\nAnother function that can be used to remove part of a string is `take`. The `take` function returns the first `n` characters of a given string. Here's an example:\n\n```\nremoveChars :: Int -> String -> String\nremoveChars n str = drop n str\n\nmain = do\n  let str = \"hello world\"\n  putStrLn (removeChars 5 str)\n```\n\nIn this example, the `removeChars` function removes the first `n` characters of the given string using the `drop` function. The output of this program will be \" world\".\n", "String_Replace": "In Haskell, we can replace a substring within a string using the `replace` function from the `Data.List` library.\n\nHere's the syntax for the `replace` function:\n\n```\nreplace :: Eq a => [a] -> [a] -> [a] -> [a]\n```\n\nwhere the first argument is the substring to be replaced, the second argument is the replacement substring, and the third argument is the original string.\n\nHere's an example to demonstrate the usage of the `replace` function:\n\n```haskell\nimport Data.List\n\nmain = do\n  let originalString = \"Hello, world!\"\n  let replacementString = \"planet\"\n  let newString = replace \"world\" replacementString originalString\n  putStrLn newString\n```\n\nIn this example, the program replaces the substring \"world\" with the word \"planet\" in the original string \"Hello, world!\". The output is:\n\n```\nHello, planet!\n```\n\nIf the substring to be replaced is not found, the `replace` function does not modify the original string and returns the original string as it is.\n\nHere's another example to demonstrate this case:\n\n```haskell\nimport Data.List\n\nmain = do\n  let originalString = \"This is a sample string.\"\n  let replacementString = \"example\"\n  let newString = replace \"notfound\" replacementString originalString\n  putStrLn newString\n```\n\nIn this example, the substring \"notfound\" is not found in the original string, so the `replace` function returns the original string as it is. The output is:\n\n```\nThis is a sample string.\n```\n", "String_Split": "In Haskell, you can split a string using the `splitOn` function from the `Data.List.Split` module. This function takes two arguments: the delimiter string and the input string.\n\nHere is an example of how to use `splitOn`:\n\n```\nimport Data.List.Split\n\ninputString = \"apples,bananas,grapes\"\ndelimiter = \",\"\n\nsplitString = splitOn delimiter inputString\n\n-- Output: [\"apples\",\"bananas\",\"grapes\"]\n```\n\nIn this example, we import the `Data.List.Split` module that contains the `splitOn` function. We define the input string variable `inputString` and the delimiter variable `delimiter`. We then call the `splitOn` function with the delimiter and input string as arguments, and assign the result to `splitString`.\n\nThe result of `splitOn` is a list of strings, where each string is a component of the original string that was separated by the delimiter. In this example, the output is `[\"apples\",\"bananas\",\"grapes\"]`.\n\nYou can also use other functions in the `Data.List.Split` module to split a string. For example, you can use `split` to split a string on a regular expression or `chunksOf` to split a string into chunks of a given length.\n", "String_Remove_leading_and_trailing_whitespace": "In Haskell, there are several ways to remove leading and trailing whitespaces from a string. One common method is to use the `Data.Text` module, which provides the `strip` function.\n\nHere is an example of how to use `strip`:\n\n```haskell\nimport Data.Text (strip)\n\n-- strip leading and trailing whitespaces\nstrip \"  Hello, world!  \"  -- returns \"Hello, world!\"\n```\n\nIn this example, the `strip` function removes all leading and trailing whitespaces from the input string \"  Hello, world!  \" and returns the result string \"Hello, world!\".\n\nAlternatively, you can also use the `trim` function from the `Data.List.Utils` module:\n\n```haskell\nimport Data.List.Utils (trim)\n\n-- trim leading and trailing whitespaces\ntrim \"  Hello, world!  \"  -- returns \"Hello, world!\"\n```\n\nThe `trim` function works similarly to `strip` and removes all leading and trailing whitespaces from the input string.\n\nRegardless of which function you use, these methods will help you remove leading and trailing whitespaces from a string in Haskell.\n", "String_Compare": "In Haskell, strings are represented as lists of characters. To compare strings, we can compare each element of the list using the equality operator (`==`) or the comparison operators (`<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`).\n\nHere is an example of comparing two strings using the equality operator:\n\n```haskell\ncompareStrings :: String -> String -> Bool\ncompareStrings s1 s2 = s1 == s2\n```\n\nWe can also compare two strings character by character using pattern matching:\n\n```haskell\ncompareStrings :: String -> String -> Bool\ncompareStrings [] [] = True\ncompareStrings (x:xs) (y:ys) = x == y && compareStrings xs ys\ncompareStrings _ _ = False\n```\n\nThe first pattern matches on empty strings and returns `True`. The second pattern matches the heads of the two strings (`x` and `y`) and recursively checks the tails of the strings (`xs` and `ys`). If the heads are equal and the tails are equal, it returns `True`. The third pattern matches any other cases and returns `False`.\n\nExample of how to compare two strings using the above function:\n\n```haskell\nghci> compareStrings \"hello\" \"hello\"  -- returns True\nghci> compareStrings \"hello\" \"world\"  -- returns False\n```\n\nNote that there is also a built-in function `compare` which returns an `Ordering` value (`LT`, `EQ`, or `GT`) and can be used to sort strings. Here is an example:\n\n```haskell\nghci> compare \"hello\" \"world\"  -- returns LT\n```", "String_Regex": "In Haskell, regex can be used with the help of the \"Text.Regex\" module which provides a regular expression matching and substitution framework. Here are some examples to illustrate the use of regex in Haskell.\n\n1. Matching a pattern in a string:\n```haskell\n-- import Text.Regex module\nimport Text.Regex\n\n-- define the pattern to match\npattern = \"lo+v(e|er)\"\n\n-- define the input string\ninput = \"love lover lovr lver lvr\"\n\n-- use the \"=~\" operator to match the pattern in the input string\nresults = input =~ pattern :: [[String]]\n\n-- display the results\nmain = putStrLn $ show results -- [[\"love\"],[\"lover\"],[\"lovr\"]]\n```\n\n2. Replacing a pattern in a string:\n```haskell\n-- import Text.Regex module\nimport Text.Regex\n\n-- define the pattern to replace\npattern = \"lo+v(e|er)\"\n\n-- define the input string\ninput = \"love lover lovr lver lvr\"\n\n-- define the replacement string\nreplacement = \"hat\"\n\n-- use the \"=~\" operator to substitute the pattern with the replacement string\noutput = input =~ pattern :: String\n\n-- display the output\nmain = putStrLn output -- \"hat hat hat lver lver\"\n```\n\n3. Extracting groups from a pattern:\n```haskell\n-- import Text.Regex module\nimport Text.Regex\n\n-- define the pattern with a group\npattern = \"([a-z]+)([0-9]+)\"\n\n-- define the input string\ninput = \"abc123 def456 ghi789\"\n\n-- use the \"=~\" operator to extract groups from the pattern in the input string\nresults = input =~ pattern :: [[String]]\n\n-- display the results\nmain = putStrLn $ show results -- [[\"abc123\",\"abc\",\"123\"],[\"def456\",\"def\",\"456\"],[\"ghi789\",\"ghi\",\"789\"]]\n```\n\nIn these examples, we have used regular expressions to match patterns, replace patterns, and extract groups from patterns in input strings. The Text.Regex module provides a powerful framework for working with regular expressions in Haskell.", "Number_Increment": "In Haskell, there are several ways to increment a number:\n\n1. Using the (+) operator:\nThe (+) operator is used to add two numbers together. To increment a number, you simply add 1 to it using the (+) operator. Here's an example:\n\n```haskell\nx = 5\ny = x + 1\n-- y now contains the value 6\n```\n\n2. Using the succ function:\nThe succ function is used to return the successor of a number. In other words, it returns the next number after the given number. Here's an example:\n\n```haskell\nx = 5\ny = succ x\n-- y now contains the value 6\n```\n\n3. Using pattern matching:\nYou can also use pattern matching to increment a number. Here's an example:\n\n```haskell\nincrement :: Int -> Int\nincrement 0 = 1\nincrement n = n + 1\n-- The above function returns the next number after the input number\n```\n\nUsing any of these methods, you can easily increment a number in Haskell.", "Number_Compare": "To compare numbers in Haskell, we use various comparison operators. Here are some of the common operators used in Haskell:\n\n1. `<` (less than)\n2. `>` (greater than)\n3. `<=` (less than or equal to)\n4. `>=` (greater than or equal to)\n5. `==` (equal to)\n6. `/=` (not equal to)\n\nFor example, let's say we have two numbers `a` and `b`. We can compare them using these operators in the following way:\n\n```Haskell\na < b -- returns True if a is less than b, otherwise False\na > b -- returns True if a is greater than b, otherwise False\na <= b -- returns True if a is less than or equal to b, otherwise False\na >= b -- returns True if a is greater than or equal to b, otherwise False\na == b -- returns True if a is equal to b, otherwise False\na /= b -- returns True if a is not equal to b, otherwise False\n```\n\nHere are some examples:\n\n```Haskell\n-- declaring two numbers\na = 5\nb = 10\n\n-- comparing the numbers\na < b -- returns True\na > b -- returns False\na <= b -- returns True\na >= b -- returns False\na == b -- returns False\na /= b -- returns True\n```\n\nIn the above example, we declare two numbers `a = 5` and `b = 10` and then we compare them using various comparison operators.", "Number_Random": "In Haskell, to generate random numbers, you need to make use of the `random` module that provides a typeclass `RandomGen`. This typeclass provides a `random` function that generates a random number and returns a new `RandomGen` generator, which can be used to generate the next random number.\n\nHere's an example of how to generate a random number using `System.Random` module:\n\n```haskell\nimport System.Random\n\nmain :: IO ()\nmain = do\n  gen <- newStdGen                    -- create a new RNG seed\n  let randomNum = fst $ random gen :: Int  -- generate a random number\n  print randomNum                    -- display the generated number\n```\n\nIn this example, we use the `newStdGen` function to create a new random number generator. Next, we generate a random number using the `random` function, which takes a random number generator as input, and produces a random number of the specified type. In this case, we use `Int` as the type of random number.\n\nAnother example using the `randomR` function to generate a random number within a given range:\n\n```haskell\nimport System.Random\n\nmain :: IO ()\nmain = do\n  gen <- newStdGen                      -- create a new RNG seed\n  let (randInt, _) = randomR (1, 10) gen :: (Int, StdGen) -- generate a random number between 1 and 10\n  print randInt                          -- display the generated number\n```\n\nIn this example, we use the `randomR` function to generate a random number within a specific range. The function takes two arguments, a tuple containing the lower and upper bounds of the range, and the random number generator. And `fst` function selects the first value (i.e., the generated random number) from the tuple returned by `randomR`.", "Number_Float": "Float numbers are decimal numbers in Haskell. They can be declared and used just like any other data type in Haskell.

We also define a function `addFloats` that takes in two float numbers and returns their sum. We call this function with two numeric arguments, `3.14` and `2.71`, and assign the result to the variable `result`. Finally, we print the result to the console using the `print` function. \n\nNote that float values are rounded to the nearest binary approximation, and thus can suffer from precision errors over long calculations. For more precision, Haskell offers the `Double` type, which represents double-precision floating-point numbers.", "Type_Get_type_of_object": "In Haskell, the `Typeable` type class is used to get the type of an object. To use this type class, you must enable the `DeriveDataTypeable` extension with the `{-# LANGUAGE DeriveDataTypeable #-}` pragma at the top of your file.\n\nHere's an example code snippet using `Typeable` type class to get the type of a value:\n\n```\n{-# LANGUAGE DeriveDataTypeable #-}\n\nimport Data.Typeable\n\n-- Define a data type\ndata Person = Person { name :: String, age :: Int } deriving Typeable\n\n-- Create an object of the Person type\nperson :: Person\nperson = Person { name = \"Alice\", age = 25 }\n\n-- Get the type of the Person object\npersonType :: String\npersonType = show $ typeOf person\n\n-- Print the type information\nmain :: IO ()\nmain = putStrLn personType\n```\n\nIn the code above, `Person` is a custom data type with two fields, `name` and `age`. The `Typeable` type class is derived for the `Person` type using the `deriving` keyword. \n\nThe `typeOf` function is used to get the type information of the `person` object, which returns a `TypeRep`. The `show` function is then used to convert the `TypeRep` to a `String` that can be printed to the console.\n\nWhen running the `main` action, the output will be: `Person {name = \"\", age = 0}`, which shows the type information of the `person` object.\n", "Type_Int_to_Float": "In Haskell, you can convert an integer to a float by using the `fromIntegral` function. Here is an example:\n\n```\n-- Convert an integer to a float\nlet myInt = 10\nlet myFloat = fromIntegral myInt :: Float\n```\n\nIn the code above, we define an integer `myInt` with a value of 10. We then use the `fromIntegral` function to convert it to a `Float` by specifying the desired type in the type signature. The resulting `myFloat` variable will have the value of 10.0 as a float.\n\nAnother example would be:\n\n```\n-- Convert the sum of two integers to a float\nlet int1 = 5\nlet int2 = 7\nlet mySum = int1 + int2\nlet myFloatSum = fromIntegral mySum :: Float\n```\n\nIn this code snippet, we define two integers `int1` and `int2` with values of 5 and 7 respectively. We then add them together and store the result in `mySum`. Finally, we use `fromIntegral` to convert `mySum` to a `Float` and store it in `myFloatSum`. The resulting `myFloatSum` variable will have the value of 12.0 as a float.", "Type_Int_to_String": "In Haskell, converting an integer to a string is very simple. You can use the `show` function to accomplish this. Here is an example:\n\n```haskell\nnumberToString :: Int -> String\nnumberToString num = show num\n```\n\nIn this example, the `numberToString` function takes an integer `num` and returns its string representation using the `show` function. For example:\n\n```haskell\n> numberToString 123\n\"123\"\n```\n\nNote that `show` can work with other types of values in Haskell, not just integers. For example, if you wanted to convert a boolean value to a string, you could also use `show`:\n\n```haskell\n> show True\n\"True\"\n```\n", "Type_String_to_Int": "In Haskell, you can convert a string to an integer using the `read` function. The `read` function takes a string as an argument and returns a value of a specific type based on the context in which it is used.\n\nTo convert a string to an integer, you can use the `read` function along with the `::` syntax to specify the specific type of integer you want the string to be converted to. Here is an example:\n\n```haskell\n-- Convert a string to an Integer\nstringToInt :: String -> Integer\nstringToInt str = read str :: Integer\n```\n\nIn this example, `stringToInt` is a function that takes a string as a parameter and returns an integer of type `Integer`. The `read` function is used to convert the string to an integer, and the `:: Integer` syntax is used to specify that the resulting value should be an `Integer`. Here are some examples of the `stringToInt` function in action:\n\n```haskell\n-- Convert the string \"123\" to an Integer\nstringToInt \"123\" -- Returns 123\n\n-- Convert the string \"-456\" to an Integer\nstringToInt \"-456\" -- Returns -456\n\n-- Convert the string \"abc\" to an Integer (will throw an exception)\nstringToInt \"abc\" -- Throws an exception because \"abc\" is not a valid integer\n```\n\nIt's important to note that the `read` function can throw an exception if the string cannot be parsed as an integer. In the last example above, `stringToInt \"abc\"` would throw an exception because \"abc\" is not a valid integer. To avoid this, you can use the `readMaybe` function from the `Text.Read` module, which returns a `Maybe` value instead of throwing an exception.\n", "Type_String_": "In Haskell, you can check if a string is a number by using the `reads` function. The `reads` function takes a string and returns a list of pairs where each pair contains a parsed value and the remaining unparsed string.

If so, then `str` can be parsed as a number and the function returns `True`. Otherwise, the function returns `False`.\n\nHere are some example inputs and their expected outputs:\n\n```\nisNumber \"123\"         -- True\nisNumber \"0.123\"       -- True\nisNumber \"-42\"         -- True\nisNumber \"not a num\"   -- False\nisNumber \"\"            -- False\n```", "Type_Null_True_False_": "In Haskell, we can check if a value is null/true/false using built-in functions such as `null`, `True`, and `False`.\n\n1.

For example:\n\n```\nnull [] -- returns True\nnull [1,2,3] -- returns False\n```\n\n2. To check if a boolean value is `True` or `False`, we can simply use the `True` and `False` keywords. For example:\n\n```\nTrue -- returns True, obviously\nFalse -- returns False, obviously\n```\n\n3. To check if a value is `Nothing` (i.e. null), we can use pattern matching with the `Maybe` type. For example:\n\n```\ncase maybeValue of\n    Just x -> -- do something with x\n    Nothing -> -- handle null case\n```\n\nIn the above example, `maybeValue` is a value of type `Maybe a`, where `a` is the type of the value we are checking.

Here is the syntax:\n\n```haskell\nlet newArray = array (lowerIndex, upperIndex) oldArray ++ [(index, element)]\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- `newArray` is the new array with the added element.\n- `array` is a function for constructing arrays.\n- `lowerIndex` and `upperIndex` specify the range of indices in the array.\n- `oldArray` is the original array.\n- The `++` operator is used to concatenate the original array with a new list containing a tuple of the index and element to be added.\n\nHere is an example:\n\n```haskell\nimport Data.Array\n\n-- create an array with three elements\nmyArray = array (1,3) [(1, \"apple\"), (2, \"banana\"), (3, \"orange\")]\n\n-- add a fourth element\nnewArray = myArray // [(4, \"grape\")]\n-- note that \"//\" is the function for updating array elements with new values\n\n-- print the old and new arrays\nmain = do\n  putStrLn \"Original array:\"\n  print myArray\n  putStrLn \"New array with added element:\"\n  print newArray\n```\n\nOutput:\n\n```\nOriginal array:\narray (1,3) [(1,\"apple\"),(2,\"banana\"),(3,\"orange\")]\nNew array with added element:\narray (1,4) [(1,\"apple\"),(2,\"banana\"),(3,\"orange\"),(4,\"grape\")]\n```\n\nIn this example, we first create an array `myArray` with three elements. We then create a new array `newArray` with the added element \"grape\" at index 4. Finally, we print both the original and new arrays for comparison.", "Array_With_different_types": "In Haskell, we can create an array with different types using the `Data.Array` module. This module provides the `Array` type which is used to represent arrays. We can create an array with different types by specifying the type of the values in the array as a tuple.\n\nHere's an example of how to create an array with different types:\n\n```\nimport Data.Array\n\n-- Define the array with different types\narr :: Array Int (String, Int, Double)\narr = array (1,3) [(1,(\"apple\",2,3.5)), (2,(\"banana\",4,5.5)), (3,(\"orange\",6,7.5))]\n\n-- Accessing the elements of the array\nitem1 = fst $ arr ! 1\nitem2 = snd $ arr ! 2\n```\n\nIn this example, we've defined an array called `arr` which has three elements. The first element is a tuple containing a string, an integer, and a double. The second and third elements are also tuples with the same structure.\n\nTo access the values in the array, we use the `!` operator followed by the index of the element we want. In this example, we've accessed the first and second elements of the array and extracted the first and second items from each tuple using the `fst` and `snd` functions, respectively. \n\nOutput:\n```\nitem1 => \"apple\"\nitem2 => (4,5.5)\n```", "Array_Include_": "In Haskell, you can check if an element is present in an array using the `elem` function. \n\nThe syntax for checking if an element is in an array is as follows:\n```\nelem :: (Eq a) => a -> [a] -> Bool\n```\n\nThe first argument is the element to check for, and the second argument is the array to search in. The function returns `True` if the element is present in the array, and `False` otherwise.\n\nHere's an example of checking if an array includes a specific element:\n```\n-- check if the number 3 is in the array\ncontainsThree = elem 3 [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n-- containsThree = True\n\n-- check if the letter 'c' is in the array\ncontainsC = elem 'c' ['a', 'b', 'd', 'e']\n-- containsC = False\n```\n\nIn the first example, the array `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` includes the element `3`, so `containsThree` is `True`. In the second example, the array `['a', 'b', 'd', 'e']` does not include the element `'c'`, so `containsC` is `False`.", "Array_Iterate": "In Haskell, iterating over an array is typically done using functions from the standard library. One common way to iterate over an array is to use the `map` function, which applies a given function to each element of an array and returns a new array with the results. Another way is to use a recursive function or a list comprehension.\n\nHere is an example of using the `map` function to iterate over an array and double each element:\n\n```haskell\narray = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\ndoubledArray = map (*2) array\n```\n\nThe resulting `doubledArray` would be `[2, 4, 6, 8, 10]`.\n\nHere is an example of using a recursive function to iterate over an array and calculate the sum of its elements:\n\n```haskell\nsumArray :: Num a => [a] -> a\nsumArray [] = 0\nsumArray (x:xs) = x + sumArray xs\n\narray = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nsum = sumArray array\n```\n\nThe resulting `sum` would be `15`.\n\nHere is an example of using a list comprehension to iterate over an array and filter out all even numbers:\n\n```haskell\narray = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\noddsArray = [x | x <- array, odd x]\n```\n\nThe resulting `oddsArray` would be `[1,3,5]`.", "Array_Iterate_with_index": "In Haskell, you can use the `zip` function to pair each element of an array with its index. Here's an example:\n\n```haskell\nmyArray = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\"]\n\n-- Using the zip function to get pairs of elements and their indices\nindexedArray = zip [0..] myArray \n\n-- Iterating over the indexed array\nfor (index, element) <- indexedArray do\n    putStrLn $ \"Element \" ++ show index ++ \" is \" ++ element\n```\n\nThe `zip` function takes two arrays as arguments and returns an array of pairs. In the example above, we are using `[0..]` to generate an infinite list of integers from `0` onwards, which is zipped with `myArray` to get an array of pairs.\n\nThe `for` loop is not a built-in construct in Haskell, but we can use the `mapM_` function to achieve a similar effect. The `mapM_` function takes a function and an array, and applies the function to each element of the array. In the example above, we are using a lambda function to print out each element and its index. The `show` function is used to convert the integers to strings so we can concatenate them with the output string.", "Array_Get_first__last_element": "In Haskell, we can get the first and last element of an array by using the functions `head` and `last`, respectively. \n\n`head` function returns the first element of a list, while `last` function returns the last element of a list. As arrays are just lists in Haskell, we can use these functions to easily get the first and last elements of an array. \n\nHere's an example:\n\n```haskell\n-- Define an array of integers\nmyArray = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n\n-- Get the first element of the array\nfirstElement = head myArray -- Output: 1\n\n-- Get the last element of the array\nlastElement = last myArray -- Output: 5\n```\n\nNote that it's important to make sure the array is not empty, since `head` and `last` will throw an error when used on an empty list.", "Array_Find_first": "In Haskell, there are several ways to find the first element of an array.\n\nOne way is to use the `head` function, which returns the first element of a list. Since arrays are a type of list in Haskell, the `head` function can also be used to find the first element of an array.\n\nHere is an example:\n\n```haskell\nmyArray = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nfirstElement = head myArray\n```\n\nIn this example, `myArray` is an array of integers, and `firstElement` is the first element of the array, which is `1`.\n\nAnother way to find the first element of an array is to use pattern matching. This involves defining a function that takes an array as an argument and matches the array to a pattern that extracts the first element.\n\nHere is an example:\n\n```haskell\nfindFirstElement :: [Int] -> Int\nfindFirstElement (x:xs) = x\n```\n\nIn this example, the function `findFirstElement` takes an array of integers as an argument and matches it to a pattern with two parts: `x`, which is the first element of the array, and `xs`, which is the rest of the array. The function returns `x`, which is the first element of the array.\n\nTo use this function, you would call it with an array as an argument, like this:\n\n```haskell\nmyArray = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nfirstElement = findFirstElement myArray\n```\n\nIn this example, `myArray` is the array of integers from before, and `firstElement` is the first element of the array, which is still `1`.\n", "Array_Select__find_all_": "To find all elements of an array satisfying a given condition in Haskell, we can use the filter function.\n\nThe filter function takes two arguments: a predicate function that returns a Boolean value, and a list. It returns a new list that contains only the elements from the original list for which the predicate function returns True.\n\nHere is an example of using filter to find all even numbers in an array of integers:\n\n```\narray = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]\nevenArray = filter (\\x -> x `mod` 2 == 0) array\n-- evenArray = [2,4,6,8,10]\n```\n\nIn this example, we define an array of integers, `array`, and then use the `filter` function to find all the even numbers in the array. The predicate function passed to `filter` is `\\x -> x `mod` 2 == 0`, which tests whether a number is even by checking if its remainder when divided by 2 is zero.\n\nAnother example is to find all the names in a list that start with the letter \"A\":\n\n```\nnames = [\"Alice\", \"Bob\", \"Amy\", \"Andrew\", \"Jane\", \"Amanda\"]\naNames = filter (\\name -> head name == 'A') names\n-- aNames = [\"Alice\", \"Amy\", \"Andrew\", \"Amanda\"]\n```\n\nIn this example, we define a list of names, `names`, and use the `filter` function to find all the names that start with the letter \"A\". The predicate function passed to `filter` is `\\name -> head name == 'A'`, which tests whether a name starts with the letter \"A\" by checking whether the first character of the name is 'A'.\n", "Array_Map__change_all_": "In Haskell, arrays are immutable data structures, meaning their elements cannot be modified once they are created. However, we can create a new array with the updated elements using the `//` operator.\n\nThe syntax to change all elements of an array is as follows:\n\n```\nnewArray = originalArray // [(i, newValue) | i <- [0..((length originalArray)-1)]]\n```\n\nHere, `(i, newValue)` is used to represent the updated value at index `i` of the new array. The list comprehension `[0..((length originalArray)-1)]` generates a list containing all the indices of the original array, allowing us to update all elements.\n\nHere's an example code that changes all elements of an array containing integers:\n\n```\nimport Data.Array\n\nmain = do\n    let origArray = array (0,4) [(i, i) | i <- [0..4]] -- Creates an array of size 5 \n                                                      -- with the values [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]\n    putStrLn \"Original array: \"\n    print origArray\n    let newArray = origArray // [(i, i*2) | i <- [0..4]] -- Creates a new array with all values\n                                                        -- multiplied by 2\n    putStrLn \"New array: \"\n    print newArray\n```\n\nThe output of this code would be:\n\n```\nOriginal array:\narray (0,4) [(0,0),(1,1),(2,2),(3,3),(4,4)]\nNew array:\narray (0,4) [(0,0),(1,2),(2,4),(3,6),(4,8)]\n```\n\nNote that while the original array remains unchanged, the new array has all its elements updated according to our specified logic.", "Array_Concatenation": "In Haskell, we can concatenate two arrays using the `++` operator.

The `++` operator is used to join the two arrays together into a single array named `concatenatedArray`. Finally, the `print` function is used to output the concatenated array.\n\nNote that the `++` operator can also be used to concatenate more than two arrays at once. For example:\n\n```haskell\n-- Defining three arrays\narray1 = [1, 2, 3]\narray2 = [4, 5, 6]\narray3 = [7, 8, 9]\n\n-- Concatenating the arrays using ++\nconcatenatedArray = array1 ++ array2 ++ array3\n\n-- Printing the concatenated array\nmain = print concatenatedArray\n```\n\nOutput:\n```\n[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]\n```", "Array_Sort": "In Haskell, we can sort an array using the `sort` function provided in the `Data.List` module.

We can do this using the following code:\n\n```\nlet myArray = [[x*y | y <- [1..4]] | x <- [1..3]]\n```\n\nHere, we are using list comprehension to create a list of lists. The inner list comprehension `[x * y | y <- [1..4]]` generates a list of values for a single row, where `x` is the row number. The outer list comprehension `[[x*y | y <- [1..4]] | x <- [1..3]]` generates the full matrix by applying the inner list comprehension for each row.\n\nThe resulting `myArray` will be:\n\n```\n[[1,2,3,4],[2,4,6,8],[3,6,9,12]]\n```\n\nAnother example is a 3-dimensional array (a cube) of size 2x2x2 with some initial values:\n\n```\nlet myArray = [[[x+y+z | z <- [1,2]] | y <- [1,2]] | x <- [1,2]]\n```\n\nHere, we are using three levels of nested list comprehension to generate the cube.

A `Just` value indicates that the key exists in the hash and contains the corresponding value, while a `Nothing` value indicates that the key does not exist in the hash.\n\nHere is an example of how to check if a key exists in a hash in Haskell:\n\n```haskell\nimport qualified Data.HashMap.Lazy as Map\n\n-- Define a hash\nhash = Map.fromList [(\"apple\", 1), (\"banana\", 2), (\"orange\", 3)]\n\n-- Check if \"apple\" exists in the hash\nappleExists = case Map.lookup \"apple\" hash of\n               Just value -> True\n               Nothing -> False\n               \n-- Check if \"watermelon\" exists in the hash\nwatermelonExists = case Map.lookup \"watermelon\" hash of\n                   Just value -> True\n                   Nothing -> False\n                   \n-- Print the results\nmain = do\n    putStrLn $ \"Does 'apple' exist in the hash? \" ++ show appleExists\n    putStrLn $ \"Does 'watermelon' exist in the hash? \" ++ show watermelonExists\n```\n\nThe above code will output:\n\n```\nDoes 'apple' exist in the hash?

If the key is present in the hash, it returns `Just` the corresponding value. Otherwise, it returns `Nothing`.\n\nYou can also use the `Map.!` operator to get the value of a key. This operator throws an error if the key is not present in the hash:\n\n```\nmyHash Map.! \"apple\" -- returns 1\nmyHash Map.! \"pear\"  -- throws an exception: \"key not found\"\n```\n\nIt's generally safer to use `Map.lookup`, since it returns a `Maybe` value that you can handle gracefully if the key is not present in the hash.", "Hash__map__Size": "In Haskell, the `Data.HashMap.Strict` module provides a `size` function to get the number of key-value pairs in a hash map.\n\nHere's an example using the `Data.HashMap.Strict` module:\n\n```haskell\nimport qualified Data.HashMap.Strict as Map\n\nmyMap = Map.fromList [(\"a\", 1), (\"b\", 2), (\"c\", 3)]\nsizeOfMyMap = Map.size myMap\n\nmain = do\n  putStrLn \"Size of myMap:\"\n  print sizeOfMyMap\n```\n\nThe `fromList` function creates a new hash map from a list of key-value pairs, and `size` returns the number of key-value pairs in the hash map.

For example:\n\n```haskell\nif x == True\n  then \"x is True\"\n  else \"x is False\"\n```\n\nThis code will return \"x is True\" if `x` is `True`, or \"x is False\" if `x` is `False`.", "Other_structure_Constant": "In Haskell, constants are used to assign fixed values to variables that cannot be changed throughout the program's execution. To declare a constant, you can use the `let` keyword followed by the name of the constant, an equal sign (which is read as \"is defined as\"), and the value of the constant.\n\nHere's an example:\n\n```\nmodule Main where\n\n-- declare constant `pi`\npi :: Double\npi = 3.14159\n\n-- define a function that calculates the area of a circle\nareaOfCircle :: Double -> Double\nareaOfCircle r = pi * r * r\n\nmain :: IO ()\nmain = do\n    -- calculate the area of a circle with radius 5\n    let radius = 5\n    let area = areaOfCircle radius\n    putStrLn $ \"The area of a circle with radius \" ++ show radius ++ \" is \" ++ show area\n```\n\nIn this example, we declare a constant `pi` and assign it the value `3.14159`. This constant is then used in the `areaOfCircle` function to calculate the area of a circle. Finally, in the `main` function, we declare two more variables `radius` and `area` using the `let` keyword and use them to calculate and display the area of a circle with radius 5.\n\nNote that in Haskell, constant variables are not truly immutable as they can be redefined later in the code. However, it is considered bad practice to do so and should be avoided in most cases.", "Other_structure_Constant_list": "In Haskell, a constant list is a list that cannot be modified once defined.

An attempt to do so will result in a compile-time error.", "Other_structure_Struct": "In Haskell, a struct is represented using records. Records are a feature of Haskell that allows you to group together different data types into a single data structure.\n\nHere's an example of how to use struct in Haskell using records:\n\n```haskell\ndata Person = Person \n  { name :: String\n  , age :: Int\n  , occupation :: String\n  }\n```\n\nIn this example, we're defining a `Person` record that consists of three fields: `name`, `age`, and `occupation`. The `name` and `occupation` fields are of type `String`, while `age` is of type `Int`. We can now create instances of this record type as follows:\n\n```haskell\nperson1 = Person \"John\" 30 \"Engineer\"\nperson2 = Person \"Mary\" 28 \"Teacher\"\n```\n\nNow, `person1` and `person2` are both instances of the `Person` record type. We can access the fields of these instances using the dot notation:\n\n```haskell\nghci> name person1\n\"John\"\nghci> age person2\n28\n```\n\nWe can also update the fields of a record using the same dot notation:\n\n```haskell\nupdatedPerson = person1 { occupation = \"Manager\" }\n```\n\nIn this example, we're creating a copy of `person1` with the `occupation` field updated to \"Manager\". The result is a new instance of the `Person` record type that has the same values for `name` and `age`, but a different value for `occupation`. \n\nSo, to summarize, in Haskell, you can use records to define a struct-like data type, and you can create instances of this data type by specifying the values for each field. You can also access and update the fields of an instance using dot notation.\n", "Conditional_If": "In Haskell, the `if` statement is used for conditional execution of code. It has the following syntax:\n\n```\nif <condition> then <expression1> else <expression2>\n```\n\nHere, `<condition>` is a boolean expression that is evaluated, and based on its value, either `<expression1>` or `<expression2>` is evaluated and returned as the result of the `if` statement.\n\nFor example, let's say we want to write a Haskell function that takes in two numbers and returns the larger number. We can use `if` statement to achieve this as follows:\n\n```haskell\nmax :: Int -> Int -> Int\nmax x y = if x > y then x else y\n```\n\nIn this code, we first define a function called `max` that takes in two integers `x` and `y`. Inside the function, we use an `if` statement to check if `x` is greater than `y`. If `x` is greater, we return `x` as the result of the function, otherwise we return `y`.\n\nWe can call this function as follows:\n\n```haskell\nmain = do\n    print (max 5 10) -- output: 10\n    print (max 15 3) -- output: 15\n    print (max 7 7) -- output: 7\n```\n\nIn this code, we call `max` function using different input values and print the results to the console using the `print` statement.", "Conditional_Unless": "In Haskell, `unless` is a predefined function in the `Control.Monad` module. It is used to perform a certain action only if a given Boolean expression is `False`. The syntax of the `unless` function is as follows:\n\n```haskell\nunless :: Monad m => Bool -> m () -> m ()\n```\n\nHere, `Monad` is a typeclass, and `m` is a type variable that represents a monadic type. The `Bool` argument is the Boolean expression to be tested, and the second argument is the action to be performed if the Boolean expression is `False`. The `m ()` part represents the monadic action, which can be thought of as a function that takes no arguments and returns no value.\n\nHere's an example that demonstrates the use of the `unless` function in Haskell:\n\n```haskell\nimport Control.Monad\n\nmain = do\n    putStrLn \"Enter a number:\"\n    input <- getLine\n    unless (null input) $ do\n        let num = read input\n        putStrLn (\"The number is \" ++ show num)\n```\n\nIn this example, the program prompts the user to enter a number. If the user enters a non-empty string, the program converts the string to a number and prints it. If the user enters an empty string, nothing happens. This behavior is achieved using the `unless` function. The `null input` expression returns `True` if the input string is empty, so the action inside the `$` symbol is only executed if the input string is not empty.\n", "Conditional_If_else": "In Haskell, the if/else expression works similarly to other programming languages. The syntax of the if/else statement is:\n\n```\nif condition then expression1 else expression2\n```\n\nHere, `condition` is the condition that is evaluated, and `expression1` and `expression2` are the results that are returned, depending on whether the condition is true or false.\n\nExample:\n\nLet's say we want to write a program that takes a number as input and checks whether it is even or odd. We can do this using the if/else statement as follows:\n\n```\nevenOdd :: Int -> String\nevenOdd num = if (mod num 2 == 0) then \"even\" else \"odd\"\n```\n\nHere, `evenOdd` is a function that takes an integer value as input and returns either \"even\" or \"odd\" based on whether the input number is even or odd. \n\nIf the condition `(mod num 2 == 0)` is true, then the function returns `\"even\"`, and if the condition is false, the function returns `\"odd\"`.\n\nWe can call this function as follows:\n\n```\nevenOdd 2 -- returns \"even\"\nevenOdd 3 -- returns \"odd\"\n```\n\nThis is just one example of using the if/else statement in Haskell. There are many other ways to use it depending on the specific requirement of your program.", "Conditional_And_Or": "In Haskell, `and` and `or` are two built-in functions that take a list of Boolean values and return a Boolean result.\n\nThe `and` function returns `True` if all elements of the list are `True`, and `False` otherwise.

Here's an example:\n\n```\n> or [True, True, False]\nTrue\n\n> or [False, False, False]\nFalse\n```\n\nYou can also use `and` and `or` in conjunction with other functions in a more complex expression. For example:\n\n```\n> let list = [1,2,3,4]\n> or (map (\\x -> x `mod` 2 == 0) list)\nTrue\n```\n\nThis code uses `map` to check whether each element of `list` is even (by checking whether its remainder when divided by 2 is 0), and `or` to check whether at least one of those elements is even.", "Conditional_Switch": "In Haskell, the `switch` statement is not available. However, the same functionality can be achieved using the `case` expression. \n\nThe `case` expression allows a value to be pattern matched against a series of patterns.

We use the `case` expression to pattern match against the result of `mod n 2`, which gives us whether the number is even (0) or odd (1). \n\nAnother example:\n\n```\ngetGrade :: Int -> String\ngetGrade score = case score of\n                   90 -> \"A\"\n                   80 -> \"B\"\n                   70 -> \"C\"\n                   _  -> \"Fail\"\n```\n\nIn this example, we define a function `getGrade` which takes an `Int` argument and returns a `String` indicating the corresponding grade. We use the `case` expression to pattern match against the value of `score`. If the value of `score` is 90, 80, or 70, we return the corresponding grade (\"A\", \"B\", or \"C\"). If the value of `score` does not match any of the patterns, we return \"Fail\". The underscore symbol (_) is used as a catch-all pattern that matches any value.", "Conditional_Switch_as_else_if": "In Haskell, the `switch` statement from many other programming languages is replaced with the `case` statement, which is a type of pattern matching. However, we can simulate the use of `else if` in Haskell using multiple `case` statements within a single function using the `case` keyword.\n\nHere is an example of how to use `case` statement as `else if` in Haskell:\n\n```\n-- Function that determines a person's age group\nageGroup :: Int -> String\nageGroup age = case age of\n                x | x < 0 -> \"Invalid age\"\n                  | x < 18 -> \"Child\"\n                  | x < 40 -> \"Young adult\"\n                  | x < 60 -> \"Middle-aged adult\"\n                  | otherwise -> \"Senior citizen\"\n```\n\nIn this code, the function `ageGroup` takes a single argument: the person's age as an integer. The `case` statement is used to check the value of `age` against a series of conditions, using `|` (or `guard`) notation. If `age` satisfies the first condition (`age < 0`), then \"Invalid age\" will be returned; if it satisfies the second condition (`age < 18`), then \"Child\" will be returned; and so on, until reaching the default clause `otherwise` which matches any value, returning \"Senior citizen\" as default age group.\n\nSo, calling `ageGroup` with `25` as argument will return \"Young adult\".

The third argument is the initial value to apply the transforming function to.\n\nHere are a few examples of using `until`:\n\nExample 1: Squaring a number until it exceeds 100\n\n```haskell\n-- Define the predicate function\nexceeds100 :: Int -> Bool\nexceeds100 x = x > 100\n\n-- Define the transforming function\nsquare :: Int -> Int\nsquare x = x * x\n\n-- Use until to repeatedly apply the transforming function to 2 until the predicate is satisfied\n-- The output should be 256 because we square 2 four times to get 16, 256 is the first number greater than 100\nmain :: IO ()\nmain = print $ until exceeds100 square 2\n```\n\nExample 2: Reversing a list until it is equal to its reverse\n\n```haskell\n-- Define the predicate function\nisPalindrome :: Eq a => [a] -> Bool\nisPalindrome lst = lst == reverse lst\n\n-- Define the transforming function\nreverseList :: [a] -> [a]\nreverseList lst = reverse lst\n\n-- Use until to repeatedly apply the transforming function to a list until the predicate is satisfied\n-- The output should be [1,2,3,2,1]\nmain :: IO ()\nmain = print $ until isPalindrome reverseList [1,2,3]\n```\n\nExample 3: Finding the square root of a number with Newton's method\n\n```haskell\n-- Define the precision value\nepsilon :: Double\nepsilon = 0.00001\n\n-- Define the predicate function\ncloseEnough :: Double -> Double -> Bool\ncloseEnough x y = abs(x - y) < epsilon\n\n-- Define the transforming function\nimproveGuess :: Double -> Double -> Double\nimproveGuess n guess = (guess + n / guess) / 2\n\n-- Define the function that uses until to find the square root of a number using Newton's method\n-- The output should be about 6.324555320336759\nsqrt' :: Double -> Double\nsqrt' n = until (closeEnough n) (improveGuess n) 1.0\n\n-- Test the function with 40 and 10000\nmain :: IO ()\nmain = do\n    putStrLn $ \"Square root of 40: \" ++ show (sqrt' 40)\n    putStrLn $ \"Square root of 10000: \" ++ show (sqrt' 10000)\n``` \n\nIn summary, `until` is a powerful function in Haskell that allows you to repeatedly transform a value until a given predicate is satisfied.", "Loop_Return_array": "In Haskell, arrays are created using the `array` function which takes a pair of indices and a list of values. To return an array, you can simply write a function that constructs an array and returns it.\n\nHere's an example function that constructs an array of integers and returns it:\n\n```\nimport Data.Array\n\nmyArray :: Array Int Int\nmyArray = array (0, 4) [(0, 1), (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4), (4, 5)]\n\ngetArray :: Array Int Int\ngetArray = myArray\n```\n\nIn this example, the `myArray` function constructs an array of integers with 5 values and indices ranging from 0 to 4. The `getArray` function simply returns this array.\n\nYou can test that this works by calling the `getArray` function and printing the result:\n\n```\nmain = do\n  let arr = getArray\n  print arr\n```\n\nThis will output:\n\n```\narray (0,4) [(0,1),(1,2),(2,3),(3,4),(4,5)]\n```", "Loop_Break": "In Haskell, `break` is a higher-order function that takes a predicate and a list and returns a tuple of two lists: the prefix of the input list before the first element that satisfies the predicate and the rest of the list.\n\nHere's the syntax of the `break` function in Haskell:\n\n```\nbreak :: (a -> Bool) -> [a] -> ([a], [a])\n```\n\nThe first argument is a function that tests the elements of the list, and the second argument is the list itself.\n\nHere's an example of using `break` function in Haskell:\n\n```\nPrelude> break (== 3) [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n([1, 2], [3, 4, 5])\n```\n\nIn this case, `break` has been used to split the list `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` into two parts: `[1, 2]` and `[3, 4, 5]`. The function `break (== 3)` checks each element of the list to see if it is equal to 3. As soon as it finds the element 3, it stops and returns the tuple of two lists.\n\nAnother example of using `break` function in Haskell:\n\n```\nPrelude> break odd [2, 4, 6, 7, 8, 10]\n([2, 4, 6], [7, 8, 10])\n```\n\nIn this case, the function `odd` is used as the predicate. The `break` function starts at the beginning of the list and checks each element until it finds an odd number. It then returns the prefix of the list up to that point (i.e., `[2, 4, 6]`) as the first element of the tuple, and the suffix of the list from that point onwards (i.e., `[7, 8, 10]`) as the second element of the tuple.", "Loop_Next_Continue": "In Haskell, both `next` and `continue` are not keywords. However, there are similar concepts that can provide their functionalities.\n\n`next` in a loop typically means skipping the current iteration of the loop and moving on to the next iteration. In Haskell, we can achieve this using recursion.\n\nConsider the following example of a function that prints numbers from 1 to 10, but skips number 5:\n\n```\nprintNumbers :: Int -> IO()\nprintNumbers n\n  | n > 10 = return ()\n  | n == 5 = printNumbers (n + 1)\n  | otherwise = do\n      print n\n      printNumbers (n + 1)\n```\n\nIn this code, if `n` is equal to 5, the function calls itself with `n+1`, effectively skipping number 5.\n\n`continue` in a loop typically means skipping the remaining code in the current iteration and moving on to the next iteration. In Haskell, we can achieve this using `guard` from the `Control.Monad` library.\n\nConsider the following example of a function that prints only even numbers from 1 to 10:\n\n```\nimport Control.Monad\n\nprintEvenNumbers :: Int -> IO()\nprintEvenNumbers n\n  | n > 10 = return ()\n  | otherwise = do\n      guard $ even n\n      print n\n      printEvenNumbers (n + 1)\n```\n\nIn this code, if `n` is not an even number, the `guard` function fails and the rest of the code in the iteration is skipped. The function then moves on to the next iteration.", "Math_Max_Min": "In Haskell, there are built-in functions to get the maximum and minimum of two numbers. Here is an example of how to use them:\n\n```haskell\nmaxNum = max 5 7\n-- maxNum will be 7\n\nminNum = min 5 7\n-- minNum will be 5\n```\n\nIn the above code, `max` and `min` are the built-in functions for finding the maximum and minimum of two numbers respectively. In the first example, we use these functions to find the maximum of `5` and `7`. The result is stored in the variable `maxNum`, which will be `7`. In the second example, we use the same functions to find the minimum of `5` and `7`. The result is stored in the variable `minNum`, which will be `5`.", "Math_Sqrt": "In Haskell, you can get the square root of a number using the `sqrt` function from the `Prelude` module.\n\nHere's an example of how to get the square root of a number in Haskell:\n\n```haskell\n-- Import the Prelude module to use the sqrt function.\nimport Prelude\n\n-- Example function to get the square root of a number.\ngetSquareRoot :: Double -> Double\ngetSquareRoot x = sqrt x\n\n-- Call the getSquareRoot function with an example value.\nresult = getSquareRoot 16.0\n-- The result will be 4.0.\n```\n\nIn the above example, we first import the `Prelude` module to use the `sqrt` function. We then define a function called `getSquareRoot` which takes a `Double` parameter `x` and returns the square root of `x` using the `sqrt` function. We then call the `getSquareRoot` function with an example value of `16.0` and store the result in the `result` variable. The result will be `4.0`.\n", "Error_handling_Try_catch_finally": "In Haskell, we use the `Control.Exception` library to implement error handling using try/catch/finally blocks. Here's an example code snippet:\n\n```haskell\nimport Control.Exception\n\ndata DivideByZero = DivideByZero deriving (Show)\n\ninstance Exception DivideByZero\n\ndivSafe :: Int -> Int -> IO Int\ndivSafe x y = handle handler $ do\n    if y == 0\n        then throwIO DivideByZero\n        else return (x `div` y)\n  where\n    handler :: DivideByZero -> IO Int\n    handler DivideByZero = return 0\n\nmain = do\n    result <- divSafe 6 2\n    print result\n    result1 <- divSafe 10 0\n    print result1\n```\n\nIn this example, we define a `divSafe` function that takes two integers and returns their division in an `IO` monad. We handle the exception caused by dividing by zero using the `handle` function, which takes two arguments: the exception handler function and the main computation to run. If a `DivideByZero` exception is thrown, the handler function returns `0`.\n\nIn the `main` function, we use `divSafe` to calculate the results of two division operations: 6/2 and 10/0. The first division is successful and returns the result, which is printed to the console using `print`. The second division throws a `DivideByZero` exception, which is caught by the `handle` function and returns `0`, which is also printed to the console.\n\nAnother way to catch exceptions is by using the `try` function, which returns an `Either` type:\n\n```haskell\nimport Control.Exception\n\ndata MyException = MyException deriving (Show)\n\ninstance Exception MyException\n\nsomeFunction :: Int -> Either MyException Int\nsomeFunction n = if n `mod` 2 == 0\n                    then Right n\n                    else Left MyException\n\nmain :: IO ()\nmain = do\n    result1 <- try (someFunction 2) :: IO (Either MyException Int)\n    print result1\n    result2 <- try (someFunction 3) :: IO (Either MyException Int)\n    print result2\n```\n\nIn this example, we define a `someFunction` that takes an integer and returns an `Either`, which may contain an exception `MyException` or an integer. We use the `try` function to catch any exceptions thrown by `someFunction` and return an `Either` type result. The `try` function wraps the main computation and returns an `IO` monad.\n\nIn the `main` function, we use `try` to calculate the result of two function calls, one with an even number and the other with an odd number. The first function call is successful and returns `Right 2`, which is printed to the console. The second function call throws a `MyException` exception, which is caught by `try` and returns the `Left MyException` result, which is also printed to the console.", "Error_handling_With_a_message": "In Haskell, we use the `Control.Exception` module to handle exceptions. The general syntax for using try/catch/finally in Haskell is as follows:\n\n```haskell\nimport Control.Exception\n\nmain = do\n    result <- try $ do\n         -- code that may throw an exception\n         return \"Success\" -- return value if no exception is thrown\n    case result of\n        Left exception -> do\n            putStrLn $ \"Caught exception: \" ++ show (exception :: SomeException)\n        Right success -> do\n            putStrLn $ \"Success: \" ++ success\n    finally Block\n```\nHere, `try` wraps the code block that might throw an exception. If an exception is thrown, then the result will be a `Left` value containing the exception, otherwise, a `Right` value containing the result of the code block is returned. The `case` statement is used to pattern match on the result to handle the exception if one occurred, or to handle the success value.\n\nThe `finally` block is optional, and is used to execute some code regardless of whether or not an exception was thrown. Here's an example with a message:\n\n```haskell\nimport Control.Exception\n\nmain = do\n    result <- try $ do\n         num1 <- readLn\n         num2 <- readLn\n         if num2 == 0\n            then throwIO DivideByZero\n            else return $ num1 `div` num2\n    case result of\n        Left DivideByZero -> do\n            putStrLn \"Caught DivideByZero exception. Cannot divide by zero!\"\n        Left exception -> do\n            putStrLn $ \"Caught exception: \" ++ show (exception :: SomeException)\n        Right quotient -> do\n            putStrLn $ \"The result of dividing \" ++ show num1 ++ \" by \" ++ show num2 ++ \" is: \" ++ show quotient\n    finally putStrLn \"Exiting program.\"\n```\nIn this example, we're trying to divide two numbers provided by user input, but we first check if the second number is zero, and throws a `DivideByZero` exception if it is. If no exception is thrown, we print out the quotient. If an exception is thrown, we print out an appropriate message. Finally, we print out a message indicating that the program is exiting, regardless of whether or not an exception was thrown.", "Error_handling_Method": "Try/catch/finally is typically not used in Haskell, as it is not a pure functional language. However, Haskell provides some control structures for exception handling which can be used to implement similar functionality as try/catch/finally.\n\nOne method of exception handling in Haskell is by using the `Control.Exception` module. This module provides a high-level interface for catching and handling different types of exceptions. Here is an example of how to use try/catch/finally in a Haskell function:\n\n```haskell\nimport Control.Exception\n\nmyFunction :: IO ()\nmyFunction = do\n  result <- try $ do\n    putStrLn \"Trying...\"\n    -- run some IO actions or functions here that may throw exceptions\n    -- if an exception is thrown, it will be caught by the catch block\n    return \"Successful result\"\n  -- The catch block will handle exceptions\n  catch (putStrLn $ \"Caught an exception: \" ++ show (result :: SomeException)) (\\e -> return ())\n  finally (putStrLn \"Finally...\") (putStrLn \"Do something after try/catch\")\n\nmain :: IO ()\nmain = do\n  myFunction\n```\nIn the above example, the `try` function wraps a block of code that could throw an exception. If the block throws an exception, it will be caught by the `catch` block, which handles the exception and prints a message. The `finally` block is executed after the `try` block is executed, regardless of whether an exception was thrown or not.\n\nNote that the `Control.Exception` module is only meant to be used in specific scenarios and when necessary. Generally speaking, pure functional programming avoids side effects and mutation, and therefore does not need exception handling in the same way that other languages require it.", "Error_handling_Throw_exception": "In Haskell, we can throw exceptions using the `throw` function from the `Control.Exception` module.\n\nHere's an example of how to throw an exception using `throw`:\n\n```haskell\nimport Control.Exception\n\ndivideByZero :: Double -> Double -> IO Double\ndivideByZero x y =\n  if y == 0\n    then throw DivideByZero\n    else return (x / y)\n```\n\nIn this example, `divideByZero` function throws the `DivideByZero` exception if `y` is zero, otherwise it returns the division result of `x` and `y`. \n\nAnother example:\n\n```haskell\nimport Control.Exception\n\ndivideByZeroAgain :: Double -> Double -> IO Double\ndivideByZeroAgain x y =\n  if y == 0\n    then throwIO DivideByZero\n    else return (x / y)\n```\n\nIn this example, we use the `throwIO` function to raise the `DivideByZero` exception instead of `throw`. The `throwIO` function is an IO-based version of `throw`. It directly throws an exception inside an IO action.\n\nBoth of these examples use the `DivideByZero` exception type, which is already defined in the Haskell base library. However, you can create custom exception types by defining your own data types. Here's an example of a custom exception type:\n\n```haskell\ndata MyException = MyException String\n  deriving (Show, Eq)\n\ninstance Exception MyException\n\nraiseMyException :: IO ()\nraiseMyException = throwIO (MyException \"Something went wrong!\")\n```\n\nIn this example, we define a custom exception type `MyException`. We use `instance Exception MyException` to declare it as an instance of the `Exception` class so that we can use it with the `throw` or `throwIO` functions. And in the last, we use `throwIO` to throw the custom exception `MyException` with a message.\n", "File_Read": "In Haskell, we can read files using the `readFile` function from the `System.IO` module. Here is an example of how to use this function:\n\n```haskell\nimport System.IO\n\nmain = do\n  fileHandle <- readFile \"example.txt\"\n  putStrLn fileHandle\n```\n\nIn this example, we have imported the `System.IO` module and defined a `main` function. Within the `main` function, we call the `readFile` function and pass it the name of the file we want to read (\"example.txt\"). The `readFile` function returns a string containing the contents of the file, which we store in the `fileHandle` variable.\n\nFinally, we use the `putStrLn` function to print the contents of the file to the console.\n\nHere is another example that shows how to read a file line by line:\n\n```haskell\nimport System.IO\n\nmain = do\n  fileHandle <- openFile \"example.txt\" ReadMode\n  contents <- hGetContents fileHandle\n  let linesOfFile = lines contents\n  mapM_ putStrLn linesOfFile\n  hClose fileHandle\n```\n\nIn this example, we use the `openFile` function to open the file in read mode, which returns a file handle. We then call the `hGetContents` function, passing it the file handle, to retrieve the contents of the file as a string.\n\nWe can use the `lines` function to split the contents into a list of strings, with each string representing a line in the file. We then use the `mapM_` function to print each line to the console, followed by the `hClose` function to close the file handle.\n\nThese are just a couple of examples of how to read a file in Haskell using the `System.IO` module.\n", "File_Write": "In Haskell, to write a file, you can use the `writeFile` function from the `System.IO` module.

Once the code is executed, a file named `example.txt` will be created in the current working directory with content \"This is an example text.\"\n\nYou can also provide a complete path for the file, for instance, `/Users/UserName/Documents/example.txt`. \n\nNote that if a file already exists with the same name/path, it will be overwritten by the content you write.\n", "File_Get_working_dir_path": "In Haskell, you can get the working directory path using the `getCurrentDirectory` function from the `System.Directory` module.\n\nHere is an example code snippet:\n\n```haskell\nimport System.Directory\n\nmain :: IO ()\nmain = do\n  currentDir <- getCurrentDirectory\n  putStrLn $ \"Current working directory: \" ++ currentDir\n```\n\nRunning this program will output the current working directory in the console.\n\nYou can also use the `getCurrentDirectory` function to get the working directory as a `FilePath`.

Instead of passing in a value for the third argument, we can just leave it out and the default value 0 will be used:\n\n```\naddNumbers 1 2         -- returns 3\naddNumbers 1 2 3       -- returns 6\n\naddTwoNumbers 1 2      -- returns 3\n```\n\nAs we can see in the above example, by setting a default value for an argument, we can make it optional, which provides more flexibility when calling the function.", "Method___Function_Return": "To return a value from a function or method in Haskell, we use the `return` keyword. The `return` keyword can be used in any function to return a value of a specific type.\n\nHere's an example of a simple function that returns a value:\n\n```\naddNumbers :: Int -> Int -> Int\naddNumbers x y = x + y\n```\n\nIn this code, the `addNumbers` function takes two integer arguments and returns their sum as an integer. The `return` keyword is not explicitly used here, but the function body implicitly returns the integer value.\n\nHere's an example of a function that uses the `return` keyword:\n\n```\ncalculateArea :: Double -> Double -> Double\ncalculateArea l w = return (l * w)\n```\n\nIn this example, the function calculates the area of a rectangle given its length and width. The `return` keyword is used to explicitly return the calculated value of the area.\n\nIt's worth noting that the `return` keyword is optional in Haskell functions. In the absence of the keyword, Haskell uses lazy evaluation to automatically return the result of the last expression in the function body.", "Method___Function_Closure": "Closure is a fundamental concept in functional programming and Haskell is a great language to learn about it.\n\nIn Haskell, a closure is a function that has access to some variables in its environment, even after those variables are no longer in scope. This means that the function 'closes over' those variables and can use them even if they are not explicitly passed as arguments to the function.\n\nHere's an example of a closure in Haskell:\n\n```haskell\nadd :: Int -> Int -> Int \nadd x = \\y -> x + y\n```\n\nIn this example, the `add` function takes an `Int` as an argument and returns a lambda function. The lambda function is the actual closure that has access to the `x` variable (the first argument to the `add` function).\n\nHere's how you might use this closure:\n\n```haskell\naddFive :: Int -> Int \naddFive = add 5\n\naddFive 7 -- returns 12\n```\n\nIn this example, we declare a new function `addFive` that is created by partially applying the `add` function with an `x` value of 5. This means that `addFive` is a new closure that has access to the `x` value of 5, which it can then add to any `y` value that is passed in.\n\nWhen we call `addFive` with `7` as an argument, it returns `12` (i.e., `5 + 7`).\n\nSo, you can use closures in Haskell to create new functions from existing ones by partially applying arguments, and those new functions can have access to variables from the original function.", "Method___Function_Block_passing": "Block passing is a technique in Haskell that allows us to pass multiple arguments as a single complex argument in a function. This is achieved by using parentheses to group the arguments together and separating them with commas. The function can then deconstruct this complex argument and use the individual arguments.\n\nHere is an example of passing two arguments to a function using block passing:\n\n```haskell\nadd :: (Int, Int) -> Int\nadd (x, y) = x + y\n```\n\nIn the above example, we define a function `add` that takes in a tuple of two integers as an argument using the block passing technique. The function then extracts the individual integers from the tuple and adds them together to get the result.\n\nWe can call the `add` function like this:\n\n```haskell\nmySum = add (5, 7) -- returns 12\n```\n\nHere is another example that illustrates the block passing technique with three arguments:\n\n```haskell\nmultiply :: (Int, Int, Int) -> Int\nmultiply (x, y, z) = x * y * z\n```\n\nIn this example, the `multiply` function takes in a tuple of three integers and returns the product of these three integers.\n\nWe can call the `multiply` function like this:\n\n```haskell\nmyProduct = multiply (2, 3, 4) -- returns 24\n```\n\nIn summary, block passing is useful in Haskell when we need to pass multiple arguments to a function, and we want to group them together to simplify the function signature. This technique can also make the code more readable and make it easier to work with complex data types.", "Method___Function_Block_binding": "Block binding in Haskell refers to defining a variable using the `let` keyword within a block of code. This variable is only valid within that block and cannot be accessed outside of it. \n\nHere is an example of using block binding in Haskell:\n\n```\n-- Define a function that calculates the circumference of a circle\ncircumference :: Float -> Float\ncircumference r = let piVal = 3.14159 -- define piVal within the block\n                  in 2 * piVal * r     -- use piVal to calculate circumference\n```\n\nHere, we define the variable `piVal` using the `let` keyword within the block of code following the function definition. We then use this variable to calculate the circumference of a circle.\n\nAnother example is:\n\n```\n-- Define a function that takes a list of integers and returns their sum\nsumList :: [Int] -> Int\nsumList lst = let sumVal = sum lst -- define sumVal within the block\n              in sumVal           -- return sumVal\n```\n\nHere, we define the variable `sumVal` using the `let` keyword within the block of code following the function definition. We then use this variable to calculate the sum of a list of integers.\n\nBlock binding is a useful tool in Haskell for defining variables within specific scopes and can make code more readable and maintainable.", "Method___Function_Initialize_in_runtime": "In Haskell, you can define a function or method, and then initialize it at runtime using the `let` keyword. Here are some examples to illustrate the process:\n\nExample 1: Defining and Initializing a Simple Function\n\nLet's say we want to define a function that calculates the square of a given number. Here's how we can use `let` to define and initialize the function at runtime:\n\n```\n-- Define the function\nsquare :: Int -> Int\nsquare x = x * x\n\nmain :: IO ()\nmain = do\n    -- Initialize the function with an argument\n    let result = square 5\n    putStrLn $ \"The square of 5 is: \" ++ show result\n```\n\nIn this example, we first define the `square` function that takes an integer `x` as input and returns the square of `x`. Then, we use `let` in our `main` function to initialize the `result` variable by calling the `square` function with a value of 5. Finally, we print the result using `putStrLn`.\n\nExample 2: Defining and Initializing a More Complex Function\n\nLet's say we want to define a function that takes a list of integers, filters out the odd numbers, squares the even numbers, and returns the sum of all the squared even numbers in the list. Here's how we can use `let` to define and initialize the function at runtime:\n\n```\n-- Define the function\nsumOfSquares :: [Int] -> Int\nsumOfSquares xs =\n  let evens = filter even xs -- filters out the odd numbers\n      squares = map square evens -- squares the even numbers\n  in sum squares -- returns the sum of squared even numbers\n\nmain :: IO ()\nmain = do\n    -- Initialize the function with a list of integers\n    let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]\n        result = sumOfSquares numbers\n    putStrLn $ \"The sum of the squares of even numbers in the list is: \" ++ show result\n```\n\nIn this example, we define the `sumOfSquares` function that takes a list of integers `xs` as input. First, we use `filter` to remove all odd numbers from the input list, and then we use `map` to square all even numbers. Finally, we use `sum` to calculate the total sum of squared even numbers, and `let` to initialize and name the intermediate variables (`evens` and `squares`). We then initialize the function with the `numbers` list using `let`, and print the result using `putStrLn`.\n\nI hope these examples demonstrate how you can use `let` to initialize functions at runtime in Haskell.", "Method___Function_Alias": "In Haskell, aliases are called type synonyms. They allow you to create a new name for an existing type. Here is an example of how to create a type synonym:\n\n```\ntype IntList = [Int]\n```\n\nThis creates a type synonym called `IntList` for the type `[Int]`. Now you can use `IntList` anywhere you would normally use `[Int]`. For example:\n\n```\nfoo :: IntList -> Int\nfoo xs = sum xs\n```\n\nHere, `foo` takes an `IntList` and returns the sum of its elements.\n\nYou can also create type synonyms for more complicated types. For example:\n\n```\ntype User = (String, Int, String)\n```\n\nThis creates a type synonym called `User` for the tuple `(String, Int, String)`. Now you can create functions that take and return `User`s:\n\n```\nuserToString :: User -> String\nuserToString (name, age, city) = name ++ \" is \" ++ show age ++ \" years old and lives in \" ++ city\n```\n\nThis function takes a `User` and returns a string representation of it.\n\nType synonyms can also be parameterized. For example:\n\n```\ntype Point a = (a, a)\n```\n\nThis creates a type synonym called `Point` that takes a type parameter `a`. This allows you to create `Point`s of any type. For example:\n\n```\norigin :: Point Int\norigin = (0, 0)\n\ndistance :: Point Double -> Point Double -> Double\ndistance (x1, y1) (x2, y2) = sqrt ((x2 - x1) ^ 2 + (y2 - y1) ^ 2)\n```\n\nHere, `origin` is a `Point Int` and `distance` takes two `Point Double`s and returns their distance.", "Class_Declare": "In Haskell, we declare a class using the `class` keyword followed by the name of the class and its constraints.

This function takes an argument of type `a` and returns nothing.\n\n```haskell\nclass Printable a where\n    printMe :: a -> IO ()\n\ninstance Printable Int where\n    printMe = print\n\ninstance Printable Char where\n    printMe c = putChar c >> putChar '\\n'\n\nmain :: IO ()\nmain = do\n    printMe (5 :: Int)\n    printMe 'c'\n```\n\nIn this example, we declare the `class Printable` with one member function `printMe` that takes an argument of type `a` and returns `IO()`. We then provide instances for the `Printable` class for types `Int` and `Char`. \n\nThe `instance Printable Int` declaration uses the `print` function which is pre-defined in Haskell to print the value of the integer. The `instance Printable Char` declaration creates a custom implementation of `printMe` that takes a `Char` argument and uses `putChar` to print the character and then a newline character.\n\nFinally, in the `main` function, we use `printMe` to print an integer and a character using their corresponding instances.", "Class_Constructor": "In Haskell, a constructor is used to create a new instance of a data type. It is defined in a data declaration and has the same name as the data type. \n\nExample: \n\nLet's say we have a data type called `Person` with two fields `name` and `age`. We can define a constructor for `Person` as:\n\n```\ndata Person = Person { name :: String, age :: Int }\n```\n\nHere, we have defined a constructor `Person` that takes in two arguments `name` and `age`. \n\nWe can create a new instance of `Person` using this constructor as:\n\n```\nperson1 = Person { name = \"John\", age = 25 }\n```\n\nHere, we have created a new instance of `Person` with name \"John\" and age 25. \n\nWe can also define multiple constructors for a data type. For example, let's say we have a data type called `Shape` that can be either a `Circle` or a `Rectangle`. We can define two constructors as:\n\n```\ndata Shape = Circle { radius :: Float }\n           | Rectangle { width :: Float, height :: Float }\n```\n\nHere, we have defined two constructors for `Shape` - `Circle` and `Rectangle`. \n\nWe can create a new instance of `Shape` using these constructors as:\n\n```\nshape1 = Circle { radius = 5 }\nshape2 = Rectangle { width = 10, height = 20 }\n```\n\nHere, we have created two instances of `Shape` - `shape1` is a circle with radius 5 and `shape2` is a rectangle with width 10 and height 20.", "Class_Method_call": "Sure, in Haskell, a method can be referred to as a function.\n\nTo call a method in Haskell, we need to first define a class with its methods or functions, and then create an instance of that class.

Then we create an instance of the \"Person\" class for the \"Student\" data structure. Finally, we define the \"introduce\" function for the \"Student\" instance and call it on an instance of the Student data structure named \"s\" in the main function. When we run this code, we'll get an output of:\n\n```\nHi, my name is Alice and I am 21 years old.\n```\n\nThis is just a basic example of how to call a method in Haskell. The syntax may change depending on the specific context and class implementation.", "Class_Static_method": "In Haskell, you can define a static method in a class by using the `class` keyword followed by the class name, then the method name and its signature.

We then define two instances of this class for two different types, `Int` and `Bool`, and provide implementations for the static method for each of them.\n\nIn the first instance, we implement the static method for the `Int` type by returning the value of the argument plus one. In the second instance, we implement the method for the `Bool` type by returning one if the argument is `True` and zero otherwise.\n\nTo use these static methods, you can simply call them using the class name and the syntax `classMethod argument`:\n\n```haskell\nmain = do\n  print $ MyStaticClass.myStaticMethod (5 :: Int)\n  print $ MyStaticClass.myStaticMethod True\n```\n\nThis will output:\n\n```\n6\n1\n```", "Class_Private_method": "In Haskell, a private method is a function that is not directly accessible from outside of the module that it is defined in.

Typeclasses define a set of functions that must be implemented for a type to be considered a member of that class. \n\nTo demonstrate inheritance in Haskell using typeclasses, let's consider an example. Suppose we want to define a hierarchy of shapes, starting with a basic Shape class and then deriving specific sub-classes such as Square and Circle. \n\nWe can define the Shape class as follows:\n\n```\nclass Shape a where\n  area :: a -> Float\n\ndata Square = Square Float\ndata Circle = Circle Float\n\ninstance Shape Square where\n  area (Square side) = side * side\n\ninstance Shape Circle where\n  area (Circle radius) = pi * radius * radius\n```\n\nIn this example, we define a `Shape` class which has only one function `area`. We then define `Square` and `Circle` as type constructors. To make `Square` and `Circle` members of `Shape` class, we define instances of the `Shape` class for them.\n\nThe `area` function is defined differently for each type. When `area` is called on a `Square` object, it returns the area of the square (which is the square of its side length). When `area` is called on a `Circle` object, it returns the area of the circle (which is pi times the square of its radius).\n\nThis example shows how inheritance is achieved through the use of typeclasses in Haskell. By defining instances of a class for different types, we can implement hierarchical relationships and reuse common functionality across multiple types.", "Class_Mixin": "Haskell is a functional programming language and doesn't have a concept of mixins like some object-oriented languages. However, we can achieve similar functionality using type classes and instances.\n\nIn Haskell, type classes are used to define a set of functions that must have an implementation for a specific type. Similarly, when we want to use \"mixin-like\" behavior, we can define a type class with default implementations for our desired set of functions.\n\nLet's take an example of implementing a \"mixin-like\" functionality for a logging feature. We can define a type class (let's call it `Loggable`) with a set of functions that our types can implement to have logging behavior.\n\n```haskell\nclass Loggable a where\n  logMsg :: a -> String -> IO ()\n\n  logDebug :: a -> String -> IO ()\n  logDebug x = logMsg x (\"[Debug] \" ++)\n\n  logInfo :: a -> String -> IO ()\n  logInfo x = logMsg x (\"[Info] \" ++)\n  \n  logError :: a -> String -> IO ()\n  logError x = logMsg x (\"[Error] \" ++)\n```\n\nNow, we can define our types and provide instance definitions for each of the log functions.\n\n```haskell\ndata Person = Person { firstName :: String\n                     , lastName :: String }\n\ninstance Loggable Person where\n  logMsg p s = putStrLn $ \"[\" ++ firstName p ++ \" \" ++ lastName p ++ \"] \" ++ s\n```\n\nIn the example above, we have defined a type `Person` and provided an instance definition for the `Loggable` type class. This means that we can use the logging functionality on an instance of `Person`.\n\nExample usage:\n\n```haskell\nmain :: IO ()\nmain = do\n  let john = Person \"John\" \"Doe\"\n  logDebug john \"Initializing app\"\n  logInfo john \"Loading data\"\n  logError john \"Data not found\"\n```\n\nOutput:\n\n```\n[John Doe] [Debug] Initializing app\n[John Doe] [Info] Loading data\n[John Doe] [Error] Data not found\n```\n\nIn this example, we have shown how we can achieve \"mixin-like\" behavior in Haskell using type classes and instances.

We then define a function `classHasMethod`, which takes a method name as an argument and returns `True` if the class has that method, and `False` otherwise.

The `maybe` function takes two arguments: a default value and a `Maybe` value. If the `Maybe` value is `Just`, then the function returns the value inside the `Just` constructor. If the `Maybe` value is `Nothing`, then the default value is returned.\n\nHere is an example of how to use `maybe` to assign a value if it does not exist:\n\n```\nmaybeValue = Nothing\ndefaultValue = 42\n\nnewValue = maybe defaultValue id maybeValue\n```\n\nIn this example, `maybeValue` is set to `Nothing`, meaning there is no value assigned to it. `defaultValue` is set to `42`, which we want to assign to `newValue` if `maybeValue` has no value.\n\nWe then use the `maybe` function to assign `maybeValue` to `newValue`, using `defaultValue` as the default value. In this case, `id` is used as the second argument to `maybe`, which is just a function that returns its input unchanged.\n\nSince `maybeValue` is `Nothing`, the default value of `42` is returned and assigned to `newValue`.\n\nHowever, if `maybeValue` had a value of, say, `Just 10`, then `10` would be returned instead and assigned to `newValue`.", "Other_Import_another_file": "In Haskell, we can import another source file into our current code with the `import` keyword. This allows us to use functions or types defined in that file in our current project. \n\nLet's say we have two files named \"File1.hs\" and \"File2.hs\" in the same directory. If we want to import functions/types defined in \"File1.hs\" into \"File2.hs\", we can use the following syntax:\n\n```haskell\n-- File2.hs\nmodule File2 where\n\nimport File1 -- import File1.hs\n\n-- rest of the code here\n```\n\nIn this example, we first declare the module name (`File2`) using the `module` keyword. Then, we use the `import` keyword to import the functions/types defined in \"File1.hs\". We don't need to include the `.hs` extension in the import statement.\n\nIn \"File1.hs\", we could define some functions like:\n\n```haskell\n-- File1.hs\nmodule File1 where\n\nmyFunction :: Int -> Int\nmyFunction x = x + 1\n```\n\nNow, in \"File2.hs\", we can use the `myFunction` function from \"File1.hs\":\n\n```haskell\n-- File2.hs\nmodule File2 where\n\nimport File1 \n\nmain = do\n  putStrLn \"Enter a number:\"\n  num <- readLn :: IO Int\n  let result = myFunction num\n  putStrLn (\"The result is: \" ++ show result)\n```\n\nIn this example, we import `File1` and use the `myFunction` function that was defined in that file. We can then use `myFunction` in our main program to transform user input.\n\nNote that when we `import` a module, we can import all its definitions or selectively import just a few of them, like this:\n\n```haskell\nimport File1 (myFunction, anotherFunction)\n```\n\nThis would only import `myFunction` and `anotherFunction` from \"File1.hs\".", "Other_Destructuring_assignment": "Destructuring assignment refers to the process of unpacking a data structure into separate variables. In Haskell, this can be achieved through pattern matching. Here are some examples:\n\n1. Destructuring tuples:\n\n``` haskell\n-- define a tuple\nmyTuple = (\"John\", 30)\n\n-- destructuring assignment\n(name, age) = myTuple\n\n-- printing the variables\nputStrLn $ \"Name: \" ++ name ++ \", Age: \" ++ show age\n```\n\nOutput:\n\n```\nName: John, Age: 30\n```\n\n2.

Destructuring custom data types:\n\n``` haskell\n-- define a custom data type\ndata Person = Person {\n    name :: String,\n    age :: Int\n} deriving (Show)\n\n-- define a person\nmyPerson = Person { name = \"John\", age = 30 }\n\n-- destructuring assignment\nPerson { name = personName, age = personAge } = myPerson\n\n-- printing the variables\nputStrLn $ \"Name: \" ++ personName ++ \", Age: \" ++ show personAge\n```\n\nOutput:\n\n```\nName: John, Age: 30\n``` \n\nBy using destructuring assignment, we can easily extract the components of a complex data structure in Haskell and work with them separately.", "Other_Date": "In Haskell, the `Data.Time` package provides functionality for working with dates. Here is an example of how to use the library to create and manipulate dates in Haskell:\n\n```haskell\nimport Data.Time\n\n-- create a date\ntoday :: IO Day\ntoday = utctDay <$> getCurrentTime\n\n-- print today's date in a specific format\nmain :: IO ()\nmain = do\n  t <- today\n  putStrLn $ \"Today is \" ++ showGregorian t\n```\n\nIn the example above, we import the `Data.Time` library and define a function `today` that returns the current date as a `Day` value. We then define a `main` function that uses `today` to print today's date in a specific format using the `showGregorian` function.\n\nHere are some other examples of how to work with dates in Haskell:\n\n```haskell\nimport Data.Time\n\n-- create a date for a specific year, month, and day\nsomeDate :: Day\nsomeDate = fromGregorian 2021 4 28\n\n-- add or subtract days from a date\nnextWeek :: Day\nnextWeek = addDays 7 someDate\n\n-- calculate the difference between two dates in days\ndaysBetween :: Day -> Day -> Integer\ndaysBetween d1 d2 = diffDays d2 d1\n```\n\nIn the example above, we create a `Day` value for a specific year, month, and day using the `fromGregorian` function. We also define a `nextWeek` value that adds 7 days to `someDate` using the `addDays` function. Finally, we define a function `daysBetween` that calculates the difference between two dates in days using the `diffDays` function.\n", "Other_Time": "In Haskell, we can use the `time` package to measure the execution time of our programs. Here's how to use it:\n\n1. Import the `Data.Time` module:\n\n```haskell\nimport Data.Time\n```\n\n2. Define a function that you want to measure the execution time of:\n\n```haskell\nmyFunction :: Int -> Int\nmyFunction n = sum [1..n]\n```\n\n3. Wrap your function inside the `getCurrentTime` and `diffUTCTime` functions. This will measure the execution time of your function:\n\n```haskell\nmain = do\n  start <- getCurrentTime\n  let result = myFunction 10000000\n  end <- getCurrentTime\n  putStrLn $ \"Result: \" ++ show result\n  putStrLn $ \"Execution time: \" ++ show (diffUTCTime end start)\n```\n\nIn this example, we're measuring the execution time of `myFunction` with an input of `10000000`. The `getCurrentTime` function gets the current time before and after the function is executed, and `diffUTCTime` calculates the difference between the two times. The result will be in picoseconds.\n\nHere's an example of what the output might look like:\n\n```\nResult: 50000005000000\nExecution time: 0.052981s\n```\n\nThis tells us that `myFunction` took approximately 0.052981 seconds to execute.", "Other_Not": "In Haskell, `not` is a Boolean negation operator that takes a single argument of type Bool and returns a Boolean value that is the opposite of the argument. If the argument is True, not will return False and vice versa.\n\nHere are some examples showing how to use `not` in Haskell:\n\n```\nnot True      -- returns False\nnot False     -- returns True\n\n-- A function that negates the result of another function\nisEven n = n `mod` 2 == 0\nisOdd = not . isEven\n\nisOdd 3       -- returns True, because 3 is odd\nisOdd 4       -- returns False, because 4 is even\n```\n\nIn the first two examples, `not` is used with literal Boolean values `True` and `False`. In the last two examples, `not` is used in combination with function composition to build a new function that negates the result of another function.", "Other_Assign_this_or_that": "The \"this or that\" you are referring to is known as the \"Either\" type in Haskell, which is a basic way of representing a value that can be one of two possible types (either A or B). The syntax for the \"Either\" type is:\n\n```haskell\ndata Either a b = Left a | Right b\n```\n\nHere, `a` and `b` are the types that can be used in the \"Either\" type. \"Left\" is used to store a value of type `a`, while \"Right\" is used to store a value of type `b\". \n\nHere are some examples to illustrate how to assign values to \"Either\" type:\n\n```haskell\n-- assigning 1 as Left (Int) \nlet value = Left 1 :: Either Int String \n\n-- assigning \"hello\" as Right (String) \nlet value2 = Right \"hello\" :: Either Int String \n\n-- assigning [\"this\", \"is\", \"a\", \"list\"] as Right ([String]) \nlet value3 = Right [\"this\", \"is\", \"a\", \"list\"] :: Either Int [String]\n```\nIn the first example, we assigned an `Int` value of 1 to the \"Left\" side of the \"Either\" type. In the second example, we assigned a `String` value of \"hello\" to the \"Right\" side of the \"Either\" type. In the third example, we assigned a list of strings to the \"Right\" side of the \"Either\" type. \n\nYou can also pattern match on an \"Either\" type to retrieve the values assigned to it using `case` statements. For example:\n\n```haskell\ncase value of \n  Left i -> putStrLn (\"Left value is \" ++ show i) \n  Right s -> putStrLn (\"Right value is \" ++ s) \n```\n\nWe first pattern match on the value to check if it is of `Left` or `Right` constructor. In the case of `Left`, we retrieve the `Int` value by assigning it to `i` and print it as a String. In the case of `Right`, we retrieve the `String` value by assigning it to `s` and print it as a String.", "Other_Run_command": "To run a command in Haskell, you need to first have the Haskell platform installed on your system.\n\nOnce you have that installed, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Open up your preferred text editor or IDE and create a new file with a `.hs` extension (e.g. \"myFile.hs\").\n\n2. Write your Haskell code in this file, making sure to include the necessary modules and functions you'll be using.\n\n3. Save the file in a convenient location on your computer.\n\n4. Open up the command prompt or terminal on your machine.\n\n5. Navigate to the directory where your Haskell file is located. \n\n6. Once you are in the directory, type the command `ghc` followed by the name of your file, like this:\n\n   ```\n   ghc myFile.hs\n   ```\n\n7. This will compile your Haskell code into an executable file. You should see a new file in the same directory as your `.hs` file, named something like `myFile.exe`.\n\n8. To run the executable, simply type its name into the command prompt and press Enter. For example:\n\n   ```\n   myFile.exe\n   ```\n\nHere is an example of how this would work with a simple \"Hello World\" program in Haskell:\n\n1. Open up your text editor and create a new file with the following content:\n\n   ```\n   module Main where\n\n   main = putStrLn \"Hello, World!\"\n   ```\n\n2. Save this file as \"hello.hs\".\n\n3. Open up your command prompt or terminal and navigate to the directory where `hello.hs` is saved.\n\n4. Type the command `ghc hello.hs` and press Enter.\n\n5. Once the compilation process is finished and an executable file has been generated, type the command `hello.exe` and press Enter.\n\n6. You should see the output \"Hello, World!\" printed in the command prompt or terminal.\n", "Importing_Libraries_import": "In Haskell, you can import libraries using the `import` keyword followed by the name of the library module.

We then use the `sort` function to sort a list of integers. Finally, we print out the sorted list using `putStrLn` and `print`.\n\nAnother example using the `Data.Map` library:\n\n```haskell\nimport qualified Data.Map as Map\n\nages = Map.fromList [(\"Alice\", 25), (\"Bob\", 30), (\"Charlie\", 22)]\n\nmain = do\n  putStrLn \"Here are the ages:\"\n  print $ Map.lookup \"Alice\" ages\n  print $ Map.lookup \"Bob\" ages\n  print $ Map.lookup \"Eve\" ages\n```\n\nIn this example, we are importing the `Data.Map` module and giving it an alias `Map`. We then create a `Map` data structure with age values for three people. Finally, we use the `lookup` function to print out the age of Alice, Bob, and Eve (who is not in the map).\n"}
