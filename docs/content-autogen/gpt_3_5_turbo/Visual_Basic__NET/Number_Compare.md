In Visual Basic .NET, you can compare numbers using the following operators:

1. Greater than: >
2. Less than: <
3. Greater than or equal to: >=
4. Less than or equal to: <=
5. Equal to: =
6. Not equal to: <>

Here are examples of how they can be used:

```
Dim x As Integer = 10
Dim y As Integer = 5

Console.WriteLine(x > y)  'output: True
Console.WriteLine(x < y)  'output: False
Console.WriteLine(x >= y) 'output: True
Console.WriteLine(x <= y) 'output: False
Console.WriteLine(x = y)  'output: False
Console.WriteLine(x <> y) 'output: True
``` 

In this example, we have defined two variables, `x` and `y`, and assigned them values of `10` and `5` respectively. 

Using the `Console.WriteLine` statement and the operators explained above, we are able to compare the values of `x` and `y` and return logical results. 

The output indicates whether each comparison is true or false.
