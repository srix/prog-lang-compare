Interpolation in Visual Basic .NET is a way to embed expressions inside strings using curly braces {}. It's a concise way to create dynamic strings that include variables, expressions, and function calls. The syntax for interpolated strings in VB .NET is to prefix a string literal with the $ symbol.

Here's an example:

```vb
Dim name As String = "John"
Dim age As Integer = 30
Dim message As String = $"My name is {name} and I am {age} years old."
Console.WriteLine(message)
```

This code uses interpolation to create a string that includes `name` and `age` variables inside the curly braces. When executed, it will output: `My name is John and I am 30 years old.`

You can also include expressions or function calls inside the curly braces. Here's an example that calculates a sum of two numbers:

```vb
Dim a As Integer = 10
Dim b As Integer = 5
Dim message As String = $"The sum of {a} and {b} is {a + b}."
Console.WriteLine(message)
```

In this example, the expression `{a + b}` is evaluated and the result is included in the final string. When executed, it will output: `The sum of 10 and 5 is 15.`

Interpolation is a useful feature when you need to generate dynamic strings that include variables or expressions without concatenating strings using the `&` operator. This simplifies the code and makes it more readable.
