In Visual Basic .NET, a closure is a block of code that can capture and retain references to variables and methods declared outside its own scope. This allows the closure to access and manipulate these variables and methods even after they have gone out of scope.

Here is an example of using a closure in Visual Basic .NET:

```
Public Function CreateAdder(ByVal addBy As Integer) As Func(Of Integer, Integer)
    Dim closureVar As Integer = 0
    Return Function(ByVal x As Integer) As Integer
               closureVar += addBy
               Return x + closureVar
           End Function
End Function
```

In this code snippet, we define a function `CreateAdder` that creates and returns a closure that can add a given amount to a number. 

The returned function is defined as `Func(Of Integer, Integer)`, which means it takes an integer parameter and returns an integer value. In its definition, it captures the value `addBy` declared in its outer scope, which means that every time it's executed, it adds the same value to the parameter.

The function also declares and initializes a variable `closureVar` inside its own scope. Because the closure captures this variable, each new closure object created by `CreateAdder` has its own instance of `closureVar` that persists between function calls.

Here's an example of how we can use this function:

```
Dim add5 As Func(Of Integer, Integer) = CreateAdder(5)
Dim result1 As Integer = add5(10) ' The result is 15 (10 + 5)
Dim result2 As Integer = add5(20) ' The result is 40 (20 + 15)
```

In this case, we create a closure object `add5` that adds 5 to its parameter. We execute it twice with different values, and see that it retains the value of `closureVar` between calls, adding 5 to the parameter on the first call and 15 on the second.

This is just one example of how you can use closures in Visual Basic .NET, and they can be used for a wide range of purposes such as event handlers, callbacks, and asynchronous programming.
