In Visual Basic .NET, primitive types are basic data types that are predefined and supported by the language itself. These primitive types are used to store simple values like numbers, characters, and Boolean values. 

There are eight primitive data types in Visual Basic .NET, which are as follows:

1. Boolean - stores true/false values.
Example: 
```
Dim isTrue As Boolean = True
```

2. Byte - stores unsigned 8-bit integers.
Example:
```
Dim byteValue As Byte = 255
```

3. Char - stores a single Unicode character.
Example:
```
Dim letter As Char = "A"
```

4. Date - stores a date value.
Example:
```
Dim currentDate As Date = Now
```

5. Decimal - stores fixed-point decimal numbers.
Example: 
```
Dim price As Decimal = 129.99D
```

6. Double - stores double-precision floating-point numbers.
Example:
```
Dim PI As Double = 3.14159
```

7. Integer - stores signed 32-bit integers.
Example: 
```
Dim integerNum As Integer = 100
```

8. Long - stores signed 64-bit integers.
Example:
```
Dim longNum As Long = 9999999999
```

These primitive types are essential in Visual Basic .NET programming as they serve as basic building blocks for the more complex data types and logic structures.
