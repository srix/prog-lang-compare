In VB.NET, you can use multiple arguments to pass multiple parameters in a method or function. Here's an example of a method with two arguments:

```vbnet
Public Function CalculateArea(ByVal length As Double, ByVal width As Double) As Double
    Return length * width
End Function
```

This method takes two arguments, `length` and `width`, and returns the area of a rectangle calculated as the product of `length` and `width`.

To call this method, you can pass the arguments in the following way:

```vbnet
Dim area As Double = CalculateArea(5.0, 3.0)
```

This code will calculate the area of a rectangle with length `5.0` and width `3.0`, and store the result in the `area` variable.

You can also use named arguments to pass multiple arguments. Here's an example:

```vbnet
Dim area As Double = CalculateArea(length:=5.0, width:=3.0)
```

This code is functionally identical to the previous example, but it uses named arguments instead of positional arguments.

Using multiple arguments in a method or function allows you to create more flexible and reusable code. By passing in different values for the arguments, you can customize the behavior of your method or function to suit different needs.
