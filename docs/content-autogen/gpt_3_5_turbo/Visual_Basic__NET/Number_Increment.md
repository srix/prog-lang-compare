To increment a number in Visual Basic .NET, you can use the `+=` operator. The `+=` operator adds the value on the right-hand side to the variable on the left-hand side. Here's an example:

```
Dim myNumber As Integer = 5
myNumber += 1
```

In this example, `myNumber` starts with a value of 5. The `+=` operator adds 1 to `myNumber`, so `myNumber` becomes 6.

You can also use the `++` operator to increment a number by 1. Here's an example:

```
Dim myNumber As Integer = 5
myNumber++
```

In this example, `myNumber` starts with a value of 5. The `++` operator adds 1 to `myNumber`, so `myNumber` becomes 6.

Alternatively, you can use the `=` operator to increment a number. Here's an example:

```
Dim myNumber As Integer = 5
myNumber = myNumber + 1
```

In this example, `myNumber` starts with a value of 5. The `=` operator assigns the sum of `myNumber` and 1 to `myNumber`, so `myNumber` becomes 6.

Note that all three of these methods increment the value of `myNumber` by 1.
