Unfortunately, Visual Basic .NET does not support mixins natively. Mixins allow you to combine multiple classes and their functionalities into a single class. This concept is more commonly found in object-oriented programming languages such as Ruby or Python. 

However, there are ways to simulate mixins in Visual Basic .NET by using interfaces and extension methods.

An interface is a contract that specifies a set of methods and properties that a class must implement. In the context of mixins, an interface can be used to define a specific set of functionalities that can be mixed into a class.

Here is an example of how an interface can be used as a mixin:

```
Public Interface IMyMixin
    Sub MyMethod()
End Interface

Public Class MyClass
    Implements IMyMixin
    Public Sub MyMethod() Implements IMyMixin.MyMethod
        Console.WriteLine("This is a mixin method!")
    End Sub
End Class

' Now we can use MyClass with the mixin
Dim obj As New MyClass()
obj.MyMethod() ' Output: "This is a mixin method!"
```

Extension methods allow you to add new functionality to an existing class without modifying its source code. In the context of mixins, extension methods can be used to add additional methods to a class.

Here is an example of how an extension method can be used as a mixin:

```
Public Module MyMixin
    <System.Runtime.CompilerServices.Extension()>
    Public Sub MyMethod(ByVal obj As Object)
        Console.WriteLine("This is a mixin method!")
    End Sub
End Module

' Now we can use the extension method as a mixin on any object
Dim obj As New Object()
obj.MyMethod() 'Output: "This is a mixin method!"
```

In conclusion, while Visual Basic .NET does not support mixins natively, they can be simulated using interfaces and extension methods.
