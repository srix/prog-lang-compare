I'm sorry, but Visual Basic .NET does not have destructuring assignment. Destructuring assignment is a feature found in JavaScript, and some other programming languages, that allows you to extract multiple values from an array or object and assign them to variables in a single statement.

However, in Visual Basic .NET, you can use array and collection methods to accomplish a similar result. 

For example, if you have an array of integers and you want to extract the first two elements and assign them to two variables, you can use the `Take` method to get the desired elements, and then assign them to variables:

```
Dim arr() As Integer = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
Dim (x, y) = arr.Take(2)
```

Here, `(x, y)` is a tuple that is declared and assigned to the result of the `Take` method. This tuple contains the first two elements of the `arr` array. 

Similarly, if you have a collection, such as a `List(Of T)` or a `Dictionary(Of TKey, TValue)`, you can use LINQ queries to extract and assign values to variables:

```
Dim dict As New Dictionary(Of String, Integer) From {
    {"A", 1}, {"B", 2}, {"C", 3}
}
Dim (key, value) = dict.First()
```

Here, `(key, value)` is a tuple that is assigned to the result of the `First` method of the dictionary. This tuple contains the first key-value pair in the dictionary. 

While this approach is not exactly the same as destructuring assignment, it allows you to extract and assign values from arrays and collections in a concise and readable way.
