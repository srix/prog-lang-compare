In Visual Basic .NET, you can execute commands or functions using the `Process.Start()` method. This method allows you to run an external application or command with arguments. Here's an example:

```vb.net
Dim processStartInfo As New ProcessStartInfo()
processStartInfo.FileName = "notepad.exe" 'the file or command you want to run
processStartInfo.Arguments = "C:\test.txt" 'arguments for the command
Process.Start(processStartInfo) 'start the process
```

In this example, the `Process.Start()` method starts the Notepad application and opens the file `C:\test.txt`. You can replace `notepad.exe` with any other executable, and specify any relevant arguments for that command.

You can also execute a command directly by passing it as an argument to the `Process.Start()` method:

```vb.net
Process.Start("cmd", "/c dir") 'runs the "dir" command in Command Prompt
```

In this example, the `Process.Start()` method starts the Command Prompt application and runs the `dir` command to list the contents of the current directory. The `/c` argument is used to terminate the Command Prompt window after the command has executed.

Note that running external applications or commands may pose security risks, so always validate user input and use caution when executing commands.
