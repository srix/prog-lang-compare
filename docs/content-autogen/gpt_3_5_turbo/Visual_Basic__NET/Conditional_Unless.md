In Visual Basic .NET, unless is not a reserved keyword. However, you can achieve the same functionality as unless using the Not operator with an If statement. 

The syntax would be: 
```vb.net
If Not condition Then
    ' statements to execute if the condition is False
End If
```

Here is an example that demonstrates the use of the Not operator with an If statement to achieve the same functionality as unless: 
```vb.net
Dim grade As Integer = 80

If Not grade >= 60 Then
    Console.WriteLine("Student has failed the course.")
End If
```
In this example, unless would have been used as follows: 
```vb.net
Unless grade >= 60 Then
    Console.WriteLine("Student has failed the course.")
End If
```
However, as previously mentioned, unless is not a reserved keyword in Visual Basic .NET.
