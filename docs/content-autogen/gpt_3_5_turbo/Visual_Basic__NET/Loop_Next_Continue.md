The `Next` and `Continue` statements are used in loops in Visual Basic .NET to control the sequence of execution of loop iterations and to skip certain iterations, respectively.

`Next` is used to jump to the next iteration of a loop. It is usually used to terminate a loop prematurely. Here is an example:

```
For i = 1 to 10
   If i = 5 Then
      Next
   End If
   Console.WriteLine(i)
Next
```

In this example, when `i` is equal to 5, the `Next` statement is executed, skipping the rest of the code in the loop and moving on to the next iteration.

`Continue` is used to skip certain iterations of a loop. It is used when you want to execute some code inside a loop for most of the iterations, but skip some iterations for some reason. Here is an example:

```
For i = 1 to 10
   If i Mod 2 = 0 Then
      Continue For
   End If
   Console.WriteLine(i)
Next
```

In this example, the `Continue For` statement is executed when `i` is even, skipping that iteration of the loop and moving on to the next iteration. For odd values of `i`, the loop continues normally and prints the value of `i` to the console.

I hope this explanation helps you use `Next` and `Continue` in your Visual Basic .NET code!
