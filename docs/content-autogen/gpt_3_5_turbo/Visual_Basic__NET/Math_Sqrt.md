To get the square root of a number in Visual Basic .NET, you can use the `Math.Sqrt` function. The `Math.Sqrt` function takes one argument which is the number for which the square root is to be calculated and returns the square root of that number.

Here's an example code snippet that demonstrates how to use the `Math.Sqrt` function in Visual Basic .NET:

```
Dim number As Double = 25
Dim squareRoot As Double = Math.Sqrt(number)
Console.WriteLine("The square root of " + number.ToString() + " is " + squareRoot.ToString())
```

In this example, the variable `number` is assigned the value 25. The `Math.Sqrt` function is then used to calculate the square root of the number and assigned to the variable `squareRoot`. Finally, the result is displayed on the console using the `Console.WriteLine` method.

When you run the above code, you will see the following output:

```
The square root of 25 is 5
```

This demonstrates how to get the square root of a number in Visual Basic .NET using the `Math.Sqrt` function.
