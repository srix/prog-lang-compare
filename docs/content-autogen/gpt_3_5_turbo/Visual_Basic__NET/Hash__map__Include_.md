In Visual Basic .NET, you can check if a hash (also known as a dictionary) includes a key using the `ContainsKey()` method. This method returns a Boolean value indicating whether the hash contains the specified key.

Here's an example:

```
' Create a new hash
Dim myHash As New Dictionary(Of String, Integer)

' Add some key-value pairs
myHash.Add("apple", 3)
myHash.Add("banana", 2)
myHash.Add("orange", 5)

' Check if the hash includes a key
Dim hasKey As Boolean = myHash.ContainsKey("banana")

If hasKey Then
    Console.WriteLine("The hash includes the key 'banana'.")
Else
    Console.WriteLine("The hash does not include the key 'banana'.")
End If
```

In this example, we create a new hash called `myHash` and add three key-value pairs to it. We then check if `myHash` includes the key "banana" using the `ContainsKey()` method. If the hash contains the key, the `hasKey` variable will be set to `True` and the message "The hash includes the key 'banana'." will be printed to the console. If the hash does not contain the key, the `hasKey` variable will be set to `False` and the message "The hash does not include the key 'banana'." will be printed to the console.
