In Lua, comments are used to write notes or remarks in the code that do not affect the program's functionality. These comments are ignored by the interpreter and do not execute.

There are two types of comments in Lua:

1. Single line comment:  A single line comment is a comment that starts with two hyphens (--) and ends at the end of the line.

Example:

```
-- This is a single line comment in Lua
```

2. Multi-line comment: A multi-line comment in Lua starts with two hyphens followed by a left square bracket (--[[) and ends with a right square bracket (]]--). These comments can span over multiple lines.

Example:

```
--[[
   This is a 
   multi-line
   comment in Lua
--]]
```

It is good practice to use comments in your code to make it more readable and understandable for yourself and other developers who may work on it in the future.
