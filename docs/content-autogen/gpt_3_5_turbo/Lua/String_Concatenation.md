In Lua, you can concatenate strings using the `..` operator. 

Here's an example:

```lua
str1 = "Hello"
str2 = "world"
result = str1 .. " " .. str2
print(result)
```

Output:

```
Hello world
```

In this example, we are concatenating `str1` and `str2` with a space in between using the `..` operator and storing the result in the `result` variable. Finally, we are printing the concatenated string using the `print` function.
