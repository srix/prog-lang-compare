In Lua, arrays are indexed starting from 1. To find the first element of an array, you simply need to reference it with the number 1 inside square brackets. Here is an example:

```
-- Define an array
myArray = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}

-- Find the first element
firstElement = myArray[1]

-- Print the result
print(firstElement) -- Outputs: apple
```

In this example, we first define an array with three elements. Then we find the first element by referencing it with `myArray[1]`. Finally, we print the result to the console using the `print` function. The output will be "apple", which is the value of the first element in the array.
