To run a command in Lua, you simply need to write the command in the Lua interpreter or in a Lua script file, and then execute the interpreter or run the script file.

Here's an example of running a command in the Lua interpreter:

1. Open the Lua interpreter in your terminal or command prompt.
2. Type the command you want to run, such as `print("Hello, world!")`.
3. Press enter to execute the command.

The interpreter should print "Hello, world!" to the screen.

Here's an example of running a command in a Lua script file:

1. Open a text editor and create a new file.
2. Write the command you want to run in the file, such as `print("Hello, world!")`.
3. Save the file with a .lua extension, such as "hello.lua".
4. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the file is saved.
5. Type `lua hello.lua` and press enter to execute the script.

The script should print "Hello, world!" to the screen.

Note that the command `print("Hello, world!")` simply prints the text "Hello, world!" to the screen. You can replace it with other Lua commands or functions depending on what you want to do.
