In Lua, the `and` and `or` operators can be used to assign a value to a variable based on a certain condition. 

The `or` operator works by returning the first value that is not nil or false. If all values are nil or false, it returns the last value.

Example:

```lua
local x = nil or 42    -- x will be assigned the value 42, as nil is false
local y = false or 43  -- y will be assigned the value 43, as false is false
local z = "foo" or "bar"-- z will be assigned the value "foo", as "foo" is not nil or false
```

The `and` operator works by returning the first nil or false value. If all values are not nil or false, it returns the last value.

Example:

```lua
local a = nil and 13                 -- a will be assigned the value nil, as nil is false
local b = false and 23               -- b will be assigned the value false, as false is false
local c = "foo" and "bar"            -- c will be assigned the value "bar", as "foo" is not nil or false
local d = "foo" and "bar" and "baz"  -- d will be assigned the value "baz", as all values are not nil or false
```

It is important to note that the `or` and `and` operators only return the value, they don't modify the variable itself. The variable must be assigned the value explicitly, for example:

```lua
local x = nil
if x == nil or x == false then
  x = 42     -- x will be assigned the value 42
end
```
