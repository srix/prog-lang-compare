In Lua, you can increment a number by simply adding 1 to it using the `+` operator or by using the `+=` operator. Here are some examples:

```
-- Using the + operator
local num = 5
num = num + 1
print(num) -- Output: 6

-- Using the += operator
local num = 5
num += 1
print(num) -- Output: 6
```

You can also increment a number by any desired value using the `+` operator. Here's an example:

```
-- Increment the number by 3
local num = 5
num = num + 3
print(num) -- Output: 8
```

Note that Lua does not have a built-in `++` operator for incrementing numbers.
