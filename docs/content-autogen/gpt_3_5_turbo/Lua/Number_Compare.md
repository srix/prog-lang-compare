In Lua, you can compare numbers using comparison operators. The following comparison operators are available in Lua:

- `>`: greater than
- `<`: less than
- `>=`: greater than or equal to
- `<=`: less than or equal to
- `~=`: not equal to
- `==`: equal to

Here are some examples of how to use comparison operators in Lua with numbers:

```lua
-- greater than
if 3 > 2 then
  print("3 is greater than 2")
end

-- less than
if 1 < 2 then
  print("1 is less than 2")
end

-- greater than or equal to
if 2 >= 2 then
  print("2 is greater than or equal to 2")
end

-- less than or equal to
if 4 <= 4 then
  print("4 is less than or equal to 4")
end

-- not equal to
if 5 ~= 6 then
  print("5 is not equal to 6")
end

-- equal to
if 5 == 5 then
  print("5 is equal to 5")
end
```

In the above examples, the print statements will get executed only if the comparison condition is true.
