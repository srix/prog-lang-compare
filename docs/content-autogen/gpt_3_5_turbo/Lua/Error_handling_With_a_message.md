In Lua, the `try/catch` mechanism does not exist by default, but it can be implemented using `pcall`. `pcall` is a Lua function that calls a function and catches any errors that occur during the execution of that function. This can be used to implement `try/catch/finally` behavior.

Here is an example of how to use `pcall` to implement a `try/catch/finally` block:

```
-- Define a function that may throw an error:
function divide(a, b)
  if b == 0 then
    error("Division by zero!")
  end
  return a / b
end

-- Use pcall to catch any errors that the 'divide' function may throw:
local success, result = pcall(divide, 10, 0)

-- Check if the call succeeded:
if success then
  print("The result is:", result)
else
  print("An error occurred:", result)
end
```

In the example above, the call to `pcall` attempts to call the `divide` function with the arguments `10` and `0`. Since this would result in a division by zero error, pcall catches the error and returns `false`, along with the error message as its second return value.

If the call to `pcall` succeeds, then `success` will be `true` and the result of the function call will be stored in `result`. If an error occurs, then `success` will be `false` and the error message will be stored in `result`.

The `finally` block can be a single `finally` statement at the end of the try-catch statement. For example:

```
try
  -- Code that might throw an error
catch err
  -- Code to handle the error
finally
  -- Code that must be executed no matter what
end
```

In Lua, the `finally` block can be implemented using the `finally` function from the `lunadry` library, like this:

```
local finally = require("lunadry").finally

-- Define a function that may throw an error:
function open_file()
  local file = io.open("file.txt", "r")
  if file == nil then
    error("Could not open file 'file.txt' for reading!")
  end
  return file
end

-- Use pcall to catch any errors that the 'open_file' function may throw:
local success, result = pcall(open_file)

-- Use 'finally' to ensure that the file is closed:
finally(function()
  if type(result) == "userdata" then
    result:close()
  end
end)

-- Check if the call succeeded:
if success then
  print("File opened successfully!")
else
  print("An error occurred:", result)
end
```

In the example above, the call to `pcall` attempts to open a file named `file.txt` for reading. If the file cannot be opened, then `open_file` throws an error and `pcall` returns `false` and the error message.

If the call to `pcall` succeeds, then `success` will be `true` and the file object will be stored in `result`. The `finally` block uses `lunadry.finally` to ensure that the file is closed no matter what happens. Finally, the code checks whether or not the call succeeded and prints the appropriate message.
