In Lua, `next` and `continue` are keywords that are used in loops to control the iteration process. 

`next` is used primarily with tables, and it returns the next key-value pair in the table. It takes two arguments, the table to iterate over (required), and the current key (optional). Here's an example:

```lua
-- a table
local myTable = {a = 1, b = 2, c = 3, d = 4}

-- iterate over the table using next and print each key-value pair
local key, value = nil, nil
while true do
  key, value = next(myTable, key)
  if not key then break end -- exit the loop once all key-value pairs have been seen
  print(key, value)
end
```

In this example, we create a table called `myTable` with four key-value pairs. We then use a `while` loop to iterate over the table using `next`. The loop will run until all key-value pairs have been seen, which is detected by the `if not key then break end` statement. Each time through the loop, `next` returns the next key-value pair, which we store in the `key` and `value` variables, and then we print these variables.

`continue` is used in loops to skip a particular iteration of the loop and move on to the next. It is not a keyword in Lua, but it can be simulated using the `goto` statement. Here's an example: 

```lua
-- iterate over a table and print each even number
local myTable = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}
for _, v in ipairs(myTable) do
  if v % 2 == 1 then goto continue end -- skip to the next iteration if the number is odd
  print(v)
  ::continue:: -- label for the skipped iteration
end
```

In this example, we create a table called `myTable` with ten values. We then use a `for` loop to iterate over the table. For each value, we check if it is even or odd using the `if v % 2 == 1 then goto continue end` statement. If the value is odd, we skip to the next iteration using a `goto` statement to the `continue` label. If the value is even, we print it using `print(v)`. The `::continue::` label is used to mark the skipped iteration, and it is required for the `goto` statement to work properly.
