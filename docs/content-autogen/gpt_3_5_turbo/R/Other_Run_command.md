To run a command in R, you simply need to type the command into the R console and press Enter. Here are some examples:

1. Print the text "Hello, world!":

```R
print("Hello, world!")
```

Output:
```
[1] "Hello, world!"
```

2. Create a variable `x` and assign it the value 5:

```R
x <- 5
```

3. Calculate the sum of two numbers, 3 and 4:

```R
sum <- 3 + 4
print(sum)
```

Output:
```
[1] 7
```

4. Generate a sequence of numbers from 1 to 10:

```R
numbers <- 1:10
print(numbers)
```

Output:
```
 [1]  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10
```

5. Create a plot of a sine wave:

```R
x <- seq(0, 2 * pi, length.out = 100)
y <- sin(x)
plot(x, y)
```

This will create a plot of a sine wave.
