In R, there are different ways to calculate the square root of a number. Here are some examples:

1. Using the sqrt() function:

The sqrt() function in R calculates the square root of a number. The syntax is as follows:

```
sqrt(x)
```

where x is the number you want to find the square root of. 

For example, to find the square root of 25 in R, you would write:

```
sqrt(25)
```

which would output:

```
[1] 5
```

2. Using the ** operator:

In R, you can also use the ** operator to calculate the square root of a number. The ** operator raises a number to a power. To find the square root of a number, you can raise it to the power of 0.5. The syntax is as follows:

```
x ** 0.5
```

where x is the number you want to find the square root of. 

For example, to find the square root of 25 using the ** operator, you would write:

```
25 ** 0.5
```

which would output:

```
[1] 5
```

3. Using the power function:

The power function in R (denoted by the ^ symbol) can also be used to calculate the square root of a number by raising it to the power of 0.5. The syntax is as follows:

```
x^0.5
```

where x is the number you want to find the square root of.

For example, to find the square root of 25 using the power function, you would write:

```
25^0.5
```

which would output:

```
[1] 5
```
