In R, there are five main primitive data types. These are:

1. Numeric: This data type represents numeric values. It includes positive and negative numbers, as well as decimal points. For example, `x <- 7` or `y <- 3.14`.

2. Logical: This data type represents logical values. It includes `TRUE` and `FALSE`. For example, `x <- TRUE` or `y <- FALSE`.

3. Character: This data type represents characters and strings. It includes combinations of letters, digits and other characters. For example, `x <- "hello, world!"` or `y <- "123"`.

4. Integer: This data type represents integer values. It includes positive and negative whole numbers. For example, `x <- 10` or `y <- -5`.

5. Complex: This data type represents complex numbers, which are numbers with real and imaginary parts. For example, `x <- 3 + 4i` or `y <- -6i`.

Here are some examples of using these primitive types in R:

```r
# Numeric
x <- 5
y <- 3.14159

# Logical
a <- TRUE
b <- FALSE

# Character
name <- "Rahul"
message <- "Hello, how are you?"

# Integer
age <- 28
siblings <- 3

# Complex
z <- 1 + 2i
```

It is important to note that R also has other data types such as lists, vectors, matrices and arrays which are built upon these primitive types.
