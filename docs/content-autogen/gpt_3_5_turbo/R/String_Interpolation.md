Interpolation is the process of embedding a value or variable within a string. In R, this can be accomplished using either the `sprintf()` function or using curly braces `{}` with an expression inside a string.

Here are examples of each method:

1. Using `sprintf()`:

```
# Defining a variable with a value to be interpolated
name <- "John"

# Using sprintf() to interpolate the variable within a string
sprintf("My name is %s.", name)
```

Output: `"My name is John."`

In this example, we define the variable `name` to have a value of `"John"`. We then use `sprintf()` to create a string that includes that value. The `%s` is a placeholder indicating that a string value should be inserted into that spot. The `name` variable is then passed as an argument to `sprintf()`, replacing the `%s` and resulting in the final string `"My name is John."`.

2. Using curly braces `{}`:

```
# Defining a variable with a value to be interpolated
age <- 32

# Using curly braces to interpolate the variable within a string
"I am {age} years old."
```

Output: `"I am 32 years old."`

In this example, we define the variable `age` to have a value of `32`. We then create a string that includes the expression `{age}` within curly braces. When the string is printed, the expression is evaluated and replaced with the value of the `age` variable, resulting in the final string `"I am 32 years old."`. Note that the curly braces can also contain more complex expressions, such as functions with arguments, mathematical operations, or logical statements.
