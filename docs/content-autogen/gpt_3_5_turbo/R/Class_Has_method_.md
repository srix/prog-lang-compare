In R, you can check if a class has a particular method using the `methods` function. This function returns all the methods for a particular generic function or class. You can use this to check if a class has a particular method or not.

Here's an example. Let's say you have a class `MyClass` and you want to check if it has a method named `myMethod`. You can use the following code:

```
# define a class
setClass("MyClass",
  slots = list(
  slot1 = "character",
  slot2 = "numeric"
  )
)

# define a method
setMethod("myMethod", "MyClass", function(x) {
  print("Hello World!")
})

# check if the class has the method
methods("myMethod")
```

This will output:

```
[1] myMethod
```

This means that the class `MyClass` has a method named `myMethod`. If the output would have been empty, it would mean that the class does not have a method with the given name.
