In R, there are two ways to add comments to your code. The first and most common method is to use the '#' symbol. Any text that comes after the '#' symbol on that line will be ignored by R. 

For example:

```
# This is a comment. It is being ignored by R.
x <- 5 # This line of code assigns the value 5 to the variable x.
```

The second method for adding comments in R is to use multi-line comments enclosed in `/*` and `*/`. This method makes it easy to add comments across multiple lines of code. 

For example:

```
/*
This is a multi-line comment.
It can span across multiple lines of code.
*/

x <- 5 # This line of code assigns the value 5 to the variable x.
```

Both of these methods are useful for adding explanations or notes to your code, which can help you or others understand your code better.
