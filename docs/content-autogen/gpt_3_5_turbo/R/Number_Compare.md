In R, we can compare two numbers using comparison operators. There are six comparison operators in R as listed below:

1. `>` (greater than): It returns `TRUE` if the left operand is greater than the right operand, otherwise `FALSE`.

2. `<` (less than): It returns `TRUE` if the left operand is less than the right operand, otherwise `FALSE`.

3. `>=` (greater than or equal to): It returns `TRUE` if the left operand is greater than or equal to the right operand, otherwise `FALSE`.

4. `<=` (less than or equal to): It returns `TRUE` if the left operand is less than or equal to the right operand, otherwise `FALSE`.

5. `==` (equal to): It returns `TRUE` if the two operands are equal, otherwise `FALSE`.

6. `!=` (not equal to): It returns `TRUE` if the two operands are not equal, otherwise `FALSE`.

Here are some examples for comparing numbers using these operators in R:

```
# Greater than operator
3 > 2    # TRUE
5 > 7    # FALSE

# Less than operator
2 < 3    # TRUE
6 < 4    # FALSE

# Greater than or equal to operator
4 >= 4   # TRUE
5 >= 7   # FALSE

# Less than or equal to operator
9 <= 9   # TRUE
8 <= 5   # FALSE

# Equal to operator
2 == 2   # TRUE
6 == 3   # FALSE

# Not equal to operator
3 != 4   # TRUE
8 != 8   # FALSE
```

These comparison operators can be used in combination with conditional statements and loops to build more complex programs in R.
