To get the maximum or minimum of two numbers in R, we can use the `max()` and `min()` functions respectively. 

For example, if we want to find the maximum of two numbers, say 5 and 7, we can simply call the `max()` function with these two numbers as the arguments as shown below:

```
max(5, 7)
```

This returns the output `7`, indicating that 7 is the larger of the two numbers.

Similarly, if we want to find the minimum of two numbers, we can call the `min()` function with the two numbers as below:

```
min(5, 7)
```

This returns the output `5`, indicating that 5 is the smaller of the two numbers.

We can also store the values in variables and pass them to the functions like so:

```
x <- 5
y <- 7

max(x, y)
min(x, y)
``` 

These will return the same results as before, but now we are using variables instead of literals.
