To increment a number in JavaScript - ECMAScript 2021, you can use the unary `++` operator, which increases the value of the variable by 1. It can be used in both prefix and postfix forms.

Here are a few examples:

```
let num = 5;
num++; // postfix increment operator
console.log(num); // Output: 6

let x = 10;
++x; // prefix increment operator
console.log(x); // Output: 11
```

In the above example, the first use of `++` is postfix, so the value of `num` is incremented after it is returned and the output value is `6`. In the second example, the `++` operator is prefix, which means the value of `x` is incremented before the value is returned to the console and the output value is `11`.
