In JavaScript, you can compare numbers using comparison operators. Here are the comparison operators available in JavaScript:

* `>` - greater than
* `<` - less than
* `>=` - greater than or equal to
* `<=` - less than or equal to
* `==` - equal to (checks value only)
* `!=` - not equal to (checks value only)
* `===` - equal to (checks both value and data type)
* `!==` - not equal to (checks both value and data type)

Example 1: Greater than comparison

```javascript
const a = 5;
const b = 3;

console.log(a > b); // Output: true
```

Example 2: Less than comparison

```javascript
const x = 10;
const y = 20;

console.log(x < y); // Output: true
```

Example 3: Greater than or equal to comparison

```javascript
const m = 15;
const n = 20;

console.log(m >= n); // Output: false
```

Example 4: Less than or equal to comparison

```javascript
const p = 10;
const q = 10;

console.log(p <= q); // Output: true
```

Example 5: Equal to comparison (checking value only)

```javascript
const r = 10;
const s = "10";

console.log(r == s); // Output: true
```

Example 6: Not equal to comparison (checking value only)

```javascript
const t = 7;
const u = "10";

console.log(t != u); // Output: true
```

Example 7: Equal to comparison (checking both value and data type)

```javascript
const v = 10;
const w = "10";

console.log(v === w); // Output: false
```

Example 8: Not equal to comparison (checking both value and data type)

```javascript
const x = 10;
const y = "10";

console.log(x !== y); // Output: true
```

These are some of the ways to compare numbers in JavaScript using ECMAScript 2021.
