In JavaScript (ECMAScript 2021), `and` and `or` are logical operators that can be used to create conditional expressions. 

The symbol `&&` represents the `and` operator, while the symbol `||` represents the `or` operator. 

The `and` operator `&&` returns `true` if both operands are true, otherwise it returns `false`. 

Example:

```
const a = 10;
const b = 5;
const c = 15;

// Using && (and) operator
if (a > b && b < c) {
  console.log("a is greater than b AND b is less than c");
}
```

In this example, the code inside the `if` statement will be executed if `a` is greater than `b` AND `b` is less than `c`.

The `or` operator `||` returns `true` if at least one operand is true, otherwise it returns `false`.

Example:

```
const isFemale = true;
const isTall = false;

// Using || (or) operator
if (isFemale || isTall) {
  console.log("You are either female or tall or both");
}
```

In this example, the code inside the `if` statement will be executed if the person is either female OR tall OR both.

Note that both `&&` and `||` operators short-circuit, which means that they evaluate the second operand only if necessary. If the first operand is enough to determine the result, the second operand is not evaluated at all.

For example, in the expression `a || b`, if `a` is `true`, `b` is not evaluated, because the result is already `true`. Similarly, in the expression `a && b`, if `a` is `false`, `b` is not evaluated, because the result is already `false`. This can be useful for performance reasons and for avoiding errors when evaluating complex expressions.
