In Java, a string represents a sequence of characters. To create a string in Java, you can use either a string literal or a string object.

Here are two examples of creating a string in Java:

1. Using a string literal:

```java
String myString = "Hello, world!"; 
System.out.println(myString); // Output: Hello, world!
```

In this example, "Hello, world!" is a string literal, enclosed in double quotes. We simply assign the string to the variable `myString` and print it out using the `System.out.println()` method.

2. Using a string object:

```java
String myString = new String("Java is awesome!"); 
System.out.println(myString); // Output: Java is awesome!
```

In this example, we create a string object using the `new` keyword and assign it to the variable `myString`. We then print it out using the `System.out.println()` method.

Both methods produce the same output and it is up to the developer to choose which method to use. It's worth noting that string literals are more commonly used in Java as they are generally more concise and easier to read.
