In C#, get and set are accessors that allow us to define the read and write behavior of properties in a class. This mechanism is used to achieve encapsulation and protect the data inside a class from any unintended modification. 

Here's an example of how to use get and set accessors in C#:

```
public class Student
{
    private string _name;
    private int _age;

    public string Name
    {
        get { return _name; }
        set { _name = value; }
    }

    public int Age
    {
        get { return _age; }
        set { _age = value; }
    }
}
```

In the example above, we have defined a class Student with private fields _name and _age. We have also defined two properties Name and Age with get and set accessors. These properties can be used to access the private fields outside the class.

For instance, we can create an object of the Student class and set the Name and Age properties as shown below:

```
Student student = new Student();
student.Name = "John Doe";
student.Age = 20;
```

We can also retrieve the values of these properties by calling them as shown below:

```
Console.WriteLine("Name: " + student.Name);
Console.WriteLine("Age: " + student.Age);
```

This would output:

```
Name: John Doe
Age: 20
```

Overall, get and set accessors provide us a powerful mechanism to define the read and write behavior of properties in a class, ensuring that the object's data remain safe and closed from unintentional or malicious modifications.
