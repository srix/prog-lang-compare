Sure, in C#, the `for` loop is commonly used to execute a set of statements repeatedly for a specific number of times. The general syntax of the `for` loop is as follows:

```
for(initialization;condition;step)
{
    // statements to be executed
}
```

- `initialization` - This part is executed only once before the start of the loop. It is used to initialize the loop variable(s) to some value.
- `condition` - This part is evaluated at the beginning of every iteration. It serves as the termination condition for the loop and if it's true, the loop will continue; otherwise, the loop will terminate.
- `step` - This part is executed at the end of each iteration of the loop. It changes the value of the loop variable(s) so that the termination condition is eventually met. 

Here's an example of a `for` loop that prints the numbers 1 to 10:

```
for(int i=1; i<=10; i++)
{
    Console.WriteLine(i);
}
```
In this example, the loop variable `i` is initialized to 1, and the termination condition is `i<=10`. The loop will execute 10 times (for `i=1` to `i=10`) since the value of `i` increments by one at the end of each iteration (`i++`).

Another example, let's say you want to print the numbers 1 to 20 but only the even numbers, you can do it with step:

```
for(int i=2; i<=20; i+=2)
{
    Console.WriteLine(i);
}
```
In this example, the loop variable `i` is initialized to 2 (even number), and the termination condition is `i<=20`. The loop will execute 10 times (for `i=2` to `i=20` in increments of 2) since the value of `i` increments by 2 at the end of each iteration (`i+=2`).

I hope this helps!
