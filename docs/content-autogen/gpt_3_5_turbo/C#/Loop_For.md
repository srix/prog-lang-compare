In C#, `for` is a looping statement that allows you to execute a set of statements repeatedly based on a specified condition. A `for` loop in C# consists of three parts: initialization, condition, and iteration.

Here's the basic syntax of a `for` loop in C#:

```csharp
for (initialization; condition; iteration)
{
    // code to be executed repeatedly
}
```

Here's an explanation of each part:

- Initialization: This part of the loop is executed only once when the loop is started. It usually initializes a counter variable to the first value in a series.
- Condition: This part of the loop is evaluated before each iteration. If it's true, the loop continues to execute. If it's false, the loop terminates.
- Iteration: This part of the loop is executed after each iteration. It usually increments the counter variable by a fixed amount.

Here's an example of a `for` loop that prints the numbers from 1 to 5:

```csharp
for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++)
{
    Console.WriteLine(i);
}
```

Output:
```
1
2
3
4
5
```

In this example, the loop starts with an `i` value of 1, checks that the `i` value is less than or equal to 5, and increments `i` by 1 after each iteration.

You can also use the `break` and `continue` statements inside a `for` loop to control the flow of execution. For example:

```csharp
for (int i = 1; i <= 10; i++)
{
    if (i == 5)
    {
        continue; // skip the rest of the loop for i = 5
    }
    if (i == 8)
    {
        break; // exit the loop for i = 8
    }
    Console.WriteLine(i);
}
```

Output:
```
1
2
3
4
6
7
```
