The `next` and `continue` keywords in C# are used to control the flow of the loop. They are used to skip or bypass certain iterations of the loop based on a specific condition. 

`continue`: The `continue` keyword is used to skip the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. It is often used inside a loop in combination with an `if` statement. 

Example: 

```
for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++)
{
    if (i == 5)
    {
        continue; // Skip iteration when i = 5
    }
    Console.WriteLine(i);
}
```

In the above example, the loop will print all the values of `i` except when `i` equals 5. When `i == 5`, the `continue` keyword is executed and the loop moves to the next iteration.

`next`: The `next` keyword is not a valid keyword in C#. It might have been confused with the `continue` keyword which serves a similar purpose.
