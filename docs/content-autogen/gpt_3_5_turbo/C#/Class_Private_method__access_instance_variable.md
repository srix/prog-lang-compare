In C#, instance variables are typically declared as private to encapsulate the data and avoid direct access from outside the class. However, there may be situations where a private method needs to access these instance variables to perform some operation.

To access a private instance variable within a private method in C#, you can use the `this` keyword. The `this` keyword refers to the current instance of the class. Here is an example:

```
class MyClass
{
    private int myVariable = 42;

    private void MyPrivateMethod()
    {
        int result = this.myVariable * 2;
        Console.WriteLine("The result is: " + result);
    }
}
```

In the above example, `MyPrivateMethod()` is a private method that accesses the private instance variable `myVariable` using the `this` keyword. The method multiplies the value of `myVariable` by 2 and outputs the result to the console.

It is important to note that private methods and instance variables should only be accessed within the class, not from outside. This helps to maintain encapsulation and prevent unwanted modifications to the data.
