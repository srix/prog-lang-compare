In C#, we can define a method or function with multiple arguments, which are variables or values passed to the method for it to perform some task. Here's an example of a method with multiple arguments:

```
public void AddNumbers(int num1, int num2)
{
    int sum = num1 + num2;
    Console.WriteLine("The sum of {0} and {1} is {2}", num1, num2, sum);
}
```

This method takes two integer arguments: `num1` and `num2`. Inside the method body, we add the two numbers and output the sum using `Console.WriteLine`.

To call this method, we need to pass in two integers:

```
AddNumbers(2, 3); // Outputs: The sum of 2 and 3 is 5
```

Here's another example of a function with multiple arguments that returning a value:

```
public int MultiplyNumbers(int num1, int num2)
{
    int product = num1 * num2;
    return product;
}
```

This function also takes two integer arguments: `num1` and `num2`. Inside the function body, we multiply the two numbers and return the product using the `return` keyword.

To call this function and get the product returned:

```
int result = MultiplyNumbers(4, 5);
Console.WriteLine("The product of 4 and 5 is {0}", result); // Outputs: The product of 4 and 5 is 20
```

These are some simple examples of methods and functions with multiple arguments, which can be very helpful in programming when multiple inputs are needed to perform a task.
