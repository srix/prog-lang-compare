In C#, the `unless` keyword is not a built-in feature. However, it can be simulated using the `if` statement and the negation operator (`!`). 

The `unless` keyword is often used in other programming languages to represent the opposite of an `if` statement. In other words, the code inside the `unless` block will be executed if the condition is false.

Here's an example of using `if` and `!` to simulate unless:

```csharp
int x = 5;
if (!(x == 10)) // This is equivalent to: unless (x == 10)
{
    Console.WriteLine("x is not equal to 10");
}
```

In this example, we first check if `x` is equal to `10` by using the equality operator (`==`). However, we negate the condition using the negation operator (`!`), which effectively results in an `unless` statement. 

If `x` is not equal to `10`, the code inside the `if` block will be executed, and "x is not equal to 10" will be printed to the console.

It's important to note that the `unless` keyword itself is not part of C#, and it's always better to use understandable and maintainable code rather than relying on a non-standard language feature.
