In C#, we can provide default values to the parameters of a method or function. This means that even if a user does not provide a value for a specific parameter, the method will still work correctly with the default value that has been specified.

Here's an example of how to use default values in C#:

```csharp
// Method with default parameter value
public void SendMessage(string message, string recipient = "all") {
    // Send the message to the recipient (or all recipients)
}

// Call the method with both parameters
SendMessage("Hello, World!", "John");

// Call the method with just the message parameter, using the default recipient
SendMessage("Hello, World!");
```
In the above example, the `SendMessage` method has two parameters - `message` and `recipient`. The `recipient` parameter has been given a default value of `"all"`. 

When we call the method with two arguments (message and recipient), it will work as expected and send a message to the specified recipient. 

However, when we call the method with just one argument (message), the compiler will assign the default value of `"all"` to the `recipient` parameter automatically. This means the message will be sent to all recipients.

This makes our code more flexible and helps us avoid errors caused by missing arguments. It also makes the method easier to use since we don't have to provide every single argument every time we call it.
