In C#, we can get the size of a hash using the `sizeof` operator. However, this only works for fixed-size value types, not for dynamic data structures like hashes.

To get the actual size of a hash, we need to calculate the size of each key-value pair and the overhead of the dictionary structure itself. Here's an example of how we can measure the size of a hash in C#:

```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Runtime.InteropServices;

class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        Dictionary<int, string> hash = new Dictionary<int, string>();
        hash.Add(1, "one");
        hash.Add(2, "two");
        hash.Add(3, "three");

        int size = 0;
        foreach (var item in hash)
        {
            size += sizeof(int);  // size of key (an int)
            size += sizeof(char) * item.Value.Length;  // size of value (a string)
        }
        size += Marshal.SizeOf(hash);  // size of dictionary structure overhead

        Console.WriteLine($"Size of hash: {size} bytes");
    }
}
```

In this example, we create a dictionary with some key-value pairs, and then loop through the pairs to calculate the size of each key-value pair. We use the `sizeof` operator for the key size (an `int`), and we calculate the size of the value (a `string`) by multiplying the length of the string by the size of a `char` (which is 2 bytes in C#). Finally, we add the size of the dictionary structure itself using the `Marshal.SizeOf` method.

Note that this calculation only gives us an approximate size of the hash, since there may be additional overhead in the memory allocation and management of the hash data structure. Also, hash values with the same keys are not stored once, so if there are same keys, there may be a different overhead value to consider.
