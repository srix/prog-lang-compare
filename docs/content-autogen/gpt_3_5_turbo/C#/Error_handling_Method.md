The try/catch/finally block is used in C# to handle exceptions that may occur during program execution. Here is an example of how to use it in a method:

```
public void DivideIntegers(int a, int b) {
    try {
        int result = a / b;
        Console.WriteLine($"The result is: {result}");
    }
    catch (DivideByZeroException ex) {
        Console.WriteLine("Error: cannot divide by zero.");
    }
    finally {
        Console.WriteLine("Execution complete.");
    }
}
```

In this example, the `DivideIntegers` method takes two integers as arguments and attempts to divide them. The `try` block contains the code that might cause an exception, in this case the division operation. If an exception occurs, the `catch` block catches the exception and handles it appropriately. In this case, a message is printed to the console indicating that division by zero is not allowed. 

The `finally` block is optional and is executed regardless of whether an exception occurred. In this example, the message "Execution complete" is printed to the console after the try/catch block completes whether or not an exception occurred.

Here's an example of how to call the `DivideIntegers` method:

```
DivideIntegers(10, 5); // Output: "The result is: 2 | Execution complete."
DivideIntegers(10, 0); // Output: "Error: cannot divide by zero. | Execution complete."
```
