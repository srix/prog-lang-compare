To create an array in C#, use the following syntax:

```csharp
datatype[] arrayname = new datatype[size];
```

Here is an example of an array of integers with a size of 5:

```csharp
int[] numbers = new int[5];
```

This creates an array of integers named `numbers` with a size of 5. The values of the array are not initialized, meaning they are set to their default value which is 0.

To initialize values into the array, you can use the following syntax:

```csharp
datatype[] arrayname = {value1, value2, value3};
```

Here is an example of an array of integers with values initialized:

```csharp
int[] numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
```

This creates an array of integers named `numbers` with values initialized to 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.
