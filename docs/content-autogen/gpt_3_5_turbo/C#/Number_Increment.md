To increment a number in C#, use the increment operator (++) which adds 1 to the value of the variable. The operator can be placed either before or after the variable. 

Here are some examples:

Example 1: Using the increment operator after the variable
```
int x = 5;
x++;
Console.WriteLine(x); // Output: 6
```

Example 2: Using the increment operator before the variable
```
int y = 10;
++y;
Console.WriteLine(y); // Output: 11
```

The output for both examples is the same since both methods increment the value of the variable by 1.
