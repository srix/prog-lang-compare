In C#, primitive types are basic data types that are used to store simple values. There are eight primitive types in C#. Here are some examples:

1. bool: Represents a Boolean value that is either true or false.

Example:

```
bool isTrue = true;
bool isFalse = false;
```

2. byte: Represents an 8-bit unsigned integer.

Example:

```
byte myByte = 255;
```

3. sbyte: Represents an 8-bit signed integer.

Example:

```
sbyte mySByte = -128;
```

4. char: Represents a single Unicode character.

Example:

```
char myChar = 'A';
```

5. short: Represents a 16-bit signed integer.

Example:

```
short myShort = -32768;
```

6. ushort: Represents a 16-bit unsigned integer.

Example:

```
ushort myUShort = 65535;
```

7. int: Represents a 32-bit signed integer.

Example:

```
int myInt = -2147483648;
```

8. uint: Represents a 32-bit unsigned integer.

Example:

```
uint myUInt = 4294967295;
```
