In C#, we can get the square root of a number using the `Math.Sqrt` method. This method takes a double or float number as input and returns its square root as a double. Here's an example:

```
double number = 25;
double sqrt = Math.Sqrt(number);
Console.WriteLine(sqrt);
```

In this example, we first initialize the `number` variable with the value `25`. We then call the `Math.Sqrt` method with `number` as argument and store its result in the `sqrt` variable. Finally, we print `sqrt` to the console using `Console.WriteLine`.

The output of this program would be:

```
5
```

which is the square root of 25.
