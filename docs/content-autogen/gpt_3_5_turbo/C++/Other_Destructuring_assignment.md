Unfortunately, C++ does not have a built-in feature for destructuring assignment like some other programming languages such as JavaScript and Python. However, you can achieve a similar effect with the help of `std::tuple`, a standard C++ library container that can hold a collection of values of different types.

Here is an example of how to use `std::tuple` to achieve destructuring assignment in C++:

```c++
#include <tuple>
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  std::tuple<int, std::string, double> my_tuple {1, "hello", 3.14};
  
  int my_int;
  std::string my_string;
  double my_double;
  
  // Destructuring assignment using std::tie
  std::tie(my_int, my_string, my_double) = my_tuple;
  
  std::cout << "my_int: " << my_int << std::endl;         // Output: my_int: 1
  std::cout << "my_string: " << my_string << std::endl;   // Output: my_string: hello
  std::cout << "my_double: " << my_double << std::endl;   // Output: my_double: 3.14
  
  return 0;
}
```

Here, we create a `std::tuple` providing it with three values of different types. We then declare three variables of types, `int`, `std::string`, and `double`. We then use `std::tie`, a standard C++ library function, to assign the values from our `my_tuple` to our three variables in one line of code.

Thus, we achieved something similar to destructuring assignment in other programming languages.
