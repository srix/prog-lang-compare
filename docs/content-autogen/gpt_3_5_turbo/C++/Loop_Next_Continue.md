`next` and `continue` are control statements in C++ used to skip over a particular iteration in a loop. The main difference between them is that `next` will skip the current iteration and continue with a new iteration while `continue` will skip the current iteration and resume with the next iteration.

Here's an example of `next` being used in a `for` loop:

```
for(int i=1; i<=10; i++) {
    if(i == 5)
        continue;
    cout << i << " ";
}
```

This loop will iterate through the values 1 to 10, but when `i` is equal to 5, the `continue` statement will skip that iteration and move on to the next iteration. The output of this loop will be:

```
1 2 3 4 6 7 8 9 10
```

Here's an example of `continue` being used in a `while` loop:

```
int i = 0;
while(i < 10) {
    i++;
    if(i % 2 == 0)
        continue;
    cout << i << " ";
}
```

This loop will iterate through the values 1 to 10, but when `i` is even, the `continue` statement will skip that iteration and move on to the next iteration. The output of this loop will be:

```
1 3 5 7 9
```
