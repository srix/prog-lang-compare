Sure, I'll be glad to help.

In Dart, we can use the `for` loop to iterate over elements in a collection. The basic syntax for the `for` loop is as follows:

```
for (var item in collection) {
  // Do something with the item
}
```

Here, `collection` can be an iterable object like List, Set, or Map. The variable `item` represents each element in the collection.

Let's look at some examples to understand this better:

Example 1: Iterating over List
```
void main() {
  var numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
  
  for (var number in numbers) {
    print(number);
  }
}
```
Output:
```
1
2
3
4
5
```

Example 2: Iterating over Map
```
void main() {
  var person = {'name': 'John', 'age': 30, 'city': 'New York'};
  
  for (var key in person.keys) {
    print('$key: ${person[key]}');
  }
}
```
Output:
```
name: John
age: 30
city: New York
```

Example 3: Iterate over a range of numbers
```
void main() {
  for (var i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
    print(i);
  }
}
```
Output:
```
1
2
3
4
5
```
