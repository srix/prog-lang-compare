To add an element to a hash (also known as a map) in Dart, you can use the following syntax:

```
myMap[key] = value;
```

Here, `myMap` is the name of the map, `key` is the key for the element you want to add, and `value` is the value you want to assign to the key. Here is an example snippet of code that demonstrates:

```
void main() {
  // Create an empty map
  var myMap = {};

  // Add an element to the map
  myMap['name'] = 'John';

  // Print the map
  print(myMap);
}
```

In the above example, we first create an empty map called `myMap`. Then, we add an element to it using the `[]` syntax with the key `"name"` and the value `"John"`. Finally, we print out the map to the console. The output should be `{'name': 'John'}`.
