Sure, writing a file in Dart requires the use of the `dart:io` library, which provides classes and methods to work with files and directories.

To write a file in Dart, you can follow these steps:

1. Import the `dart:io` library using the `import` statement:

```dart
import 'dart:io';
```

2. Use the `File` class to create a new file object. You can pass the file path as a string to the constructor:

```dart
var file = File('path/to/file.txt');
```

3. Open the file for writing using the `openWrite` method. This method returns a `Future` that completes with a `IOSink` object which is used to write data to the file:

```dart
var sink = file.openWrite();
```

4. Write data to the file using the `write` method of the `IOSink` object:

```dart
sink.write('Hello, World!');
```

5. Close the `IOSink` object to flush the data to the file and release the resources:

```dart
await sink.close();
```

Here's an example that shows how to write a string to a file in Dart:

```dart
import 'dart:io';

void main() async {
  var file = File('example.txt');
  var sink;
  try {
    sink = file.openWrite();
    await sink.write('Hello, World!');
  } catch (e) {
    print(e.toString());
  } finally {
    await sink?.close();
  }
}
```

This example creates a new file called `example.txt` in the current directory, writes the string `"Hello, World!"` to it, and then closes the file.
