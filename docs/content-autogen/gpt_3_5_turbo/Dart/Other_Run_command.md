To run a command in Dart, you need to use the Dart SDK which can be downloaded from the official Dart website. After installation, you can use either the command line or an IDE like Visual Studio Code to run your Dart code.

To run a Dart program from the command line, follow these steps:

1. Open the command prompt or terminal on your computer.
2. Navigate to the directory where your Dart program is saved using the `cd` command.
3. Once you are in the correct directory, type `dart` followed by the name of your program file and press Enter.
4. For example, if your program file is called `hello_world.dart`, you would type `dart hello_world.dart` followed by Enter.

Here's an example of a simple Dart program that prints "Hello, world!" to the console:

```dart
void main() {
  print('Hello, world!');
}
```

To run this program in Dart, save it with the name `hello_world.dart` and type the following command in the command prompt or terminal:

```
dart hello_world.dart
```

This will execute the program and print "Hello, world!" to the console.
