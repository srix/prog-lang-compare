In Dart, you can get the size of a hash (or map) using the `.length` property. Here is an example code snippet:

```
Map<String, int> ages = {'John': 30, 'Mary': 25, 'Bob': 40};
print(ages.length); // Output: 3
```

In the above code, `ages` is a map with three key-value pairs. The `.length` property returns the number of key-value pairs in the map, which is 3 in this example. You can replace the key-value pairs and variable name to your desired hash to get the length in Dart.
