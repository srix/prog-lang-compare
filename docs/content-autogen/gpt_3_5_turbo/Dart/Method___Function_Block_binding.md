Block binding in Dart allows developers to create variables that are scoped to certain blocks of code, which can help prevent variable name collisions and improve code readability. 

To use block binding, developers can use curly braces `{}` to define a block of code, and then declare variables within that block using the `var` or `final` keyword.

Here is an example:

```
void main() {
  print('Start');

  {
    var message = 'Hello world';
    print(message);
  }

  {
    final name = 'Alice';
    print('Hello $name');
  }

  print('End');
}
```

In this example, we have two blocks of code, one with a `var` variable and one with a `final` variable. These variables are scoped to their respective blocks and cannot be accessed outside of them.

The output of this code would be:

```
Start
Hello world
Hello Alice
End
```

Overall, block binding in Dart is a powerful feature that can help developers write well-scoped and organized code.
