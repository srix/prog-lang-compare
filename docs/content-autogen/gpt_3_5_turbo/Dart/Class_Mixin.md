In Dart, a mixin is a way to reuse a class's code in multiple class hierarchies. 

A mixin adds functionality to a class without creating a subclass. 

To use a mixin in Dart, you first have to define a mixin using the `mixin` keyword, followed by the mixin name and the code you want to include:

```
mixin MyMixin {
  // code you want to include
}
```

Then, you can use the `with` keyword to use the mixin in a class:

```
class MyClass with MyMixin {
  // class code
}
```

Here is a more detailed example that demonstrates how to use a mixin in Dart:

```
mixin CanFly {
  void fly() {
    print('I can fly!');
  }
}

class Bird {
  String name;

  Bird(this.name);
}

class Eagle extends Bird with CanFly {
  Eagle(String name) : super(name);
}

void main() {
  var eagle = Eagle('Golden eagle');
  eagle.fly();  // Output: I can fly!
}
```

In this example, we defined a `CanFly` mixin that adds a `fly()` method. 

We then created a `Bird` class and an `Eagle` subclass that extends from `Bird` and includes the `CanFly` mixin using the `with` keyword.

Finally, we created an instance of the `Eagle` class and called the `fly()` method to demonstrate that the `CanFly` mixin was successfully included in the class.
