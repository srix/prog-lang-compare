To find the first element of an array in Dart, you can use the `first` property. Here is an example:

```dart
void main() {
  List<int> numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
  int firstNumber = numbers.first;
  print('The first number in the array is $firstNumber'); // Output: The first number in the array is 1
}
```

In the example above, we define an array of integers called `numbers`. We then use the `first` property to get the first element in the array and assign it to the variable `firstNumber`. We then print the value of `firstNumber`. The output will be `The first number in the array is 1`.
