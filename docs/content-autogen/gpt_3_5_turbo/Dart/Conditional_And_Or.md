In Dart, `and` and `or` are used to combine boolean expressions.

The `and` operator (`&&`) is used to check if both expressions are true:

```
bool expressionA = true;
bool expressionB = false;

if(expressionA && expressionB) {
  print("This won't be printed because expressionB is false");
} else {
  print("At least one expression is false");
}
```

The output of the code above will be:

```
At least one expression is false
```

The `or` operator (`||`) is used to check if at least one of the expressions is true:

```
bool expressionC = true;
bool expressionD = false;

if(expressionC || expressionD) {
  print("At least one expression is true");
} else {
  print("Both expressions are false so this will never be printed");
}
```

The output of the code above will be:

```
At least one expression is true
```
