Sure, I would love to explain how to define a static method in a class in Dart.

Static methods in Dart are declared using the `static` keyword. They are called on the class, rather than on an instance of the class. Static methods can be used for utility or helper functions that do not depend on any instance variables, and they are useful when you need to use a method in a class without creating an instance of that class.

Here is an example of how to define a static method in a class in Dart:

```dart
class MathUtils {
  static int addNumbers(int x, int y) {
    return x + y;
  }
}

void main() {
  // call the static method directly on the class
  int sum = MathUtils.addNumbers(5, 10);
  print(sum); // output: 15
}
```

In this example, we have defined a `MathUtils` class with a static method called `addNumbers`. This method takes two integer parameters `x` and `y`, adds them together, and returns their sum. 

To call the `addNumbers` method, we don't need to create an object of `MathUtils`. We can call the method directly on the class by using the class name followed by the method name. 

In the `main()` function, we are calling the `addNumbers` method with the parameters `5` and `10`, which returns `15`. We store this value in a variable called `sum` and print it to the console.

I hope that clarifies how to define a static method in a class in Dart. Let me know if you have any questions!
