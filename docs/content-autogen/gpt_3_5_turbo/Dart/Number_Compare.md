In Dart, you can use the comparison operators to compare two numbers and produce a boolean result. 

The comparison operators are:

- `>` : Greater Than
- `<` : Less Than
- `>=`: Greater Than or Equal To
- `<=`: Less Than or Equal To
- `==`: Equality Check
- `!=`: Not Equal To

Here are some examples:

```
int x = 5;
int y = 10;

print(x > y); // Output: false
print(x < y); // Output: true
print(x >= y); // Output: false
print(x <= y); // Output: true
print(x == y); // Output: false
print(x != y); // Output: true
```

In the example above, we declared two variables `x` and `y` with initial values of `5` and `10` respectively. We then used the comparison operators to compare the values of the variables and printed the boolean result.

In the first comparison, `x` is not greater than `y`, so the output is `false`. In the second comparison, `x` is less than `y`, so the output is `true`. The same process applies to the other comparisons.
