Sure, converting an integer to a float in Swift is quite simple. You can achieve this using the type casting feature available in Swift. Here's an example:

```swift
let myInt = 5
let myFloat = Float(myInt)
print(myFloat) // prints 5.0
```

In the above example, we initialized an integer variable `myInt` with the value `5`. We then used the `Float` type casting constructor to convert `myInt` to a float and assigned it to a new variable `myFloat`. Finally, we printed `myFloat`, which outputs `5.0`. Note how the output has a decimal point now indicating that it's a float value.
