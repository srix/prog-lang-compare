Sure, I'd be happy to explain how to use multiple arguments in a method or function in Swift with examples.

In Swift, you can define a method or function that accepts multiple arguments by specifying each argument's type and name after the function's name. You can then use each argument within the function's body as needed.

Here's an example of a method that accepts two arguments and returns their sum:

```
func add(_ num1: Int, _ num2: Int) -> Int {
    return num1 + num2
}

let sum = add(4, 6)
print(sum) // Output: 10
```

In this example, the `add` method is defined with two arguments: `num1` and `num2`. Both are of type `Int`. Within the method's body, the sum of the two numbers is computed and returned. The method can be called with two integer values, and the sum of those values will be returned.

You can also specify default values for arguments to make them optional. Here's an example:

```
func greet(_ name: String, at time: String = "morning") {
    print("Good \(time), \(name)!")
}

greet("John") // Output: Good morning, John!
greet("Mary", at: "afternoon") // Output: Good afternoon, Mary!
```

In this example, the `greet` method is defined with two arguments: `name` of type `String` and `time` of type `String`, which has a default value of `"morning"`. Within the method's body, a greeting is printed based on the values of the arguments.

The `greet` method can be called with just the `name` argument, in which case the default value of `time` will be used, or it can be called with both `name` and `time` arguments.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.
