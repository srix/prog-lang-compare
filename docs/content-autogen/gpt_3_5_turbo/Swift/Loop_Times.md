In Swift, we can use the `*` symbol to multiply numbers. When it comes to using times, we can use `*` with a number on the left side and a variable or another number on the right side to signify multiplication.

Let's take a look at a few examples:

```
let number = 5
let result = number * 3 // 15
```

In this example, we are multiplying the variable `number` by the number 3. The result will be 15.

```
let age = 25
let dogYears = age * 7 // 175
```

Here, we are using times to convert the variable `age` into dog years by multiplying it by 7.

```
let cost = 12.99
let quantity = 3
let totalCost = cost * Double(quantity) // 38.97
```

In this example, we are calculating the total cost by multiplying the cost per item (`cost`) by the quantity (`quantity`) and casting the result to a `Double` in order to avoid a type mismatch error. The result will be 38.97. 

These are just a few examples of how to use times in Swift. Using multiplication in your code can be helpful for various calculations and operations.
