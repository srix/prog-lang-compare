To get the maximum and minimum of two numbers using Swift, you can use the built-in max() and min() functions.

Here is an example code that shows how to get the maximum and minimum of two numbers:

```swift
let a = 5
let b = 10

// Get the maximum of a and b
let maxNumber = max(a, b) // Output: 10

// Get the minimum of a and b
let minNumber = min(a, b) // Output: 5
```

In this example, we have two variables `a` and `b` that contain the values 5 and 10 respectively. `max()` function is used to compare the two values and return the larger one as the output. Similarly, `min()` function is used to compare the two values and return the smaller one as output.
