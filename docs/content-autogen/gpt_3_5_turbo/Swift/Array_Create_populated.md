In Swift, an array can be created using the following syntax:

```
var arrayName: [dataType] = []
```

Here is an example to create an array of integers:

```
var numbers: [Int] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```
This creates an array called `numbers` containing the integers 1 through 5.

You can also create an empty array and add elements to it later using the `append()` method. Here is an example to create an empty array of strings:

```
var names: [String] = []
```

To add elements to the `names` array, you can use the `append()` method:

```
names.append("Alice")
names.append("Bob")
names.append("Charlie")
```

This would add the strings "Alice", "Bob", and "Charlie" to the `names` array.
