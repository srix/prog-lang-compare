In Swift, you can run a command using the built-in "print" function. The "print" function can be used to output values to the console, and can take one or more arguments separated by commas. Here are some examples:

1. Printing a String:

```
print("Hello, world!")
```

This will output the message "Hello, world!" to the console.

2. Printing a Variable:

```
let name = "Alice"
print("Hello, \(name)!")
```

This will output the message "Hello, Alice!" to the console. The "\("...")" syntax is used to insert a variable value into a String.

3. Printing Multiple Items:

```
let num1 = 10
let num2 = 5
let sum = num1 + num2
print("The sum of \(num1) and \(num2) is \(sum).")
```

This will output the message "The sum of 10 and 5 is 15." to the console. The "\("...")" syntax can be used multiple times in a single String.
