In Swift, you can use the `contains` method to check if a hash includes a specific key. Here are some examples:

```
// Create a dictionary
var car: [String: String] = ["make": "Toyota", "model": "Camry", "year": "2020"]

// Check if the dictionary contains a key
if car.keys.contains("make") {
    print("The car dictionary includes the key 'make'")
} else {
    print("The car dictionary does not include the key 'make'")
}
```

```
// Create a dictionary
var student: [Int: String] = [1: "John", 2: "Jane", 3: "Jim"]

// Check if the dictionary contains a key
if student.keys.contains(4) {
    print("The student dictionary includes the key 4")
} else {
    print("The student dictionary does not include the key 4")
}
```

In these examples, we create a dictionary and use the `contains` method to check if the dictionary includes a specific key. The `keys` property is used to get an array of all the keys in the dictionary, and then we call the `contains` method on that array and pass in the key we want to check. If the key is found in the dictionary, the `contains` method returns `true`, and we print a message indicating that the key was found. Otherwise, we print a message indicating that the key was not found.
