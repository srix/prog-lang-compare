In Swift, a string is simply a sequence of characters enclosed in double quotes "".

Here's an example of how you can create a string in Swift:

```
let greeting = "Hello, world!"
```

This creates a constant named `greeting` which contains the string "Hello, world!".

You can also create a string using string interpolation. String interpolation is the process of embedding values inside a string literal by wrapping them in a pair of parentheses preceded by a backslash "\".

```
let name = "John"
let message = "Hello, \(name)!"
```

This creates a string variable named `message` which contains the string "Hello, John!".

There are many other ways to create a string in Swift including using a string initializer, appending strings, and more.
