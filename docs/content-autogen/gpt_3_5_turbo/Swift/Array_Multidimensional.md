Sure! 

In Swift, you can create a multidimensional array with the help of arrays. A multidimensional array is basically an array of arrays. 

Here's a sample code to create a 2D array and initialise it with some values:

```
var twoDArray: [[Int]] = [[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]]
```

In the above example, we have created a 2D array of integers. The outer array has three elements, which are themselves arrays with two integers each. We have initialised the array with values using the square bracket notation.

Similarly, you can create a 3D array with the help of three nested arrays. Here's a sample code to create a 3D array with some values:

```
var threeDArray: [[[Int]]] = [
    [[1, 2], [3, 4]],
    [[5, 6], [7, 8]],
    [[9, 10], [11, 12]]
]
```

In the above example, we have created a 3D array of integers. The outer array has three elements, each of which is 2D arrays with two integer elements. We have initialised the values of the array with the help of three nested arrays.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any more queries.
