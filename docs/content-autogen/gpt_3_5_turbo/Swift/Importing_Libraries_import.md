```Swift
In Swift, libraries are imported using the `import` keyword followed by the library's name. Here is an example of importing the Foundation library:
```

```Swift
import Foundation
```

```Swift
Likewise, if you want to use the UIKit framework, you would import it like this:

import UIKit
```

```Swift
In addition to importing frameworks and libraries, you can also import your own code files using the `import` keyword followed by the file's name:

import MyCustomCode
```

```Swift
Where `MyCustomCode` is the name of your custom code file. Once the file has been imported, you can then use any functions and classes defined in it.
