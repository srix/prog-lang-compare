In Swift, the `count` property can be used to get the size of a hash (or a Dictionary). The `count` property returns the number of key-value pairs in the hash. Here's an example code snippet showing how to get the size of a hash with an example:

```swift
// Define a hash with key-value pairs
var hash = ["a": 1, "b": 2, "c": 3]

// Get the size of the hash using the count property
let size = hash.count

// Print the size of the hash
print("The size of the hash is \(size)")

// Output: The size of the hash is 3
```

In the example above, we created a hash `hash` with three key-value pairs, then we used the `count` property to get the size of the hash, which is 3. Finally, we printed the size of the hash using a `print()` statement.
