Interpolation is a powerful feature in Swift that enables us to embed expressions inside a string literal. This way, we can dynamically include variables, constants, expressions, and functions right inside a string without having to concatenate them.

Here's an example:

```swift
let name = "Alice"
let age = 27
let message = "Hello, my name is \(name) and I'm \(age) years old."
print(message) // Output: Hello, my name is Alice and I'm 27 years old.
```

In this code, we're assigning the values `"Alice"` and `27` to the `name` and `age` variables respectively. Then, using string interpolation, we embed those values into the `message` string using the `\( )` syntax. The resulting message is then printed to the console.

We can also use expressions inside the interpolation block. For example:

```swift
let x = 10
let y = 5
let add = "\(x) + \(y) = \(x + y)"
let subtract = "\(x) - \(y) = \(x - y)"
print(add) // Output: 10 + 5 = 15
print(subtract) // Output: 10 - 5 = 5
```

Here, we're using the `+` and `-` operators inside the interpolation blocks to dynamically calculate the values of `add` and `subtract`.

Interpolation is a very useful feature that can save time, improve readability, and help to avoid errors caused by incorrectly concatenating strings and variables.
