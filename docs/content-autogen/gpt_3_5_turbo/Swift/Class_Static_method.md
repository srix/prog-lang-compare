Sure! In Swift, we can define a static method using the `static` keyword. A static method belongs to the class itself, as opposed to an instance of the class. That means you can call a static method without creating an instance of the class.

Here's an example of how to define a static method in Swift:

```swift
class MyClass {
    static func myStaticMethod() {
        print("This is a static method.")
    }
}
```

In this example, we've defined a static method called `myStaticMethod()` in a class called `MyClass`. To call this method, we don't need to create an instance of the class. We can simply call the method directly on the class itself:

```swift
MyClass.myStaticMethod() // Output: "This is a static method."
```

Static methods can also accept parameters, just like instance methods. Here's an example:

```swift
class MyClass {
    static func myStaticMethod(name: String) {
        print("Hello, \(name)!")
    }
}

MyClass.myStaticMethod(name: "John") // Output: "Hello, John!"
```

In this example, we've defined a static method called `myStaticMethod()` that accepts a `name` parameter. We can call this method and pass in a value for the `name` parameter just like we would with any other method. The output will be "Hello, [name]!", where `[name]` is the value we passed in.
