Sure, I'd be happy to help!

In Swift, calling a method within a class is relatively easy. Here's an example:

```swift
class MyClass {
    func myMethod() {
        print("Hello, world!")
    }
}

let myClassInstance = MyClass()
myClassInstance.myMethod() // Output: "Hello, world!"
```

In this example, we define a class named `MyClass` with one method named `myMethod()`. This method simply prints "Hello, world!" to the console.

To call this method, we first create an instance of the class by invoking the class's initializer, which is done by using the `()` operator after the class name, such as `MyClass()`. This creates a new instance of `MyClass`.

Once the instance is created, we can call `myMethod()` on that instance using the instance variable name, followed by the dot syntax and the method name, like so: `myClassInstance.myMethod()`. This will invoke the `myMethod()` method on the `myClassInstance` object and print "Hello, world!" to the console.

So, that's how you call a method within a Swift class! Let me know if you have any further questions.
