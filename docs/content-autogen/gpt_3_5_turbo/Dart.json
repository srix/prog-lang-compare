{"Datatypes_Primitives": "In Dart, primitive types are the basic building blocks for all other types. They represent basic values like numbers, strings, booleans, and null. Here are the primitive types in Dart with examples:\n\n1. Numbers: \n\nNumbers can be of two types: integers and doubles. Integers are whole numbers, while doubles are fractional numbers. \n\nExamples of integers:\n\n```\nint age = 25; \nint count = 10;\n```\n\nExamples of doubles:\n\n```\ndouble price = 10.5;\ndouble tax = 0.2;\n```\n\n2. Booleans:\n\nBooleans represent true or false values.\n\nExample:\n\n```\nbool isHuman = true;\nbool isMobile = false;\n```\n\n3. Strings:\n\nStrings are used to represent text.\n\nExample:\n\n```\nString name = \"Peter\";\nString message = \"Hello, Dart!\";\n```\n\n4. Null:\n\nThe null type represents absence of value. \n\nExample:\n\n```\nvar x = null;\n```\n\nNote that Dart also supports type inference, which allows you to omit the type annotation when declaring variables. For example:\n\n```\nvar age = 25;\nvar message = \"Hello, Dart!\";\nvar isHuman = true;\n``` \n\nHere, Dart will automatically assign the appropriate types based on the values assigned to the variables.", "String_Create": "In Dart programming language, a string is a sequence of characters enclosed in single or double quotes. To create a string, you can use either single quotes or double quotes. Here are some examples:\n\n1. Using single quotes:\n```\nString name = 'John';\n```\n\n2. Using double quotes:\n```\nString message = \"Hello, World!\";\n```\n\n3. Using triple quotes for multi-line strings:\n```\nString poem = '''\nI tried to love you\nI tried to care\nBut now I realize\nYou were never there.\n''';\n```\n\n4. Using string interpolation to concatenate variables and strings:\n```\nString firstName = 'John';\nString lastName = 'Doe';\nString fullName = 'My name is $firstName $lastName';\n```\n\nIn the above example, the dollar sign followed by curly braces is used to insert the value of a variable into a string. The resulting value of the fullName variable would be 'My name is John Doe'.", "String_Concatenation": "In Dart, you can concatenate strings by using the \"+\" operator. Here are a few examples:\n\n```\n// concatenating two strings\nString str1 = \"Hello\";\nString str2 = \"World\";\nString result = str1 + \" \" + str2;\nprint(result); // Hello World\n```\n\n```\n// concatenating multiple strings\nString name = \"John\";\nint age = 25;\nString hobby = \"playing football\";\nString result = \"My name is \" + name + \", I am \" + age.toString() + \" years old, and I enjoy \" + hobby + \".\";\nprint(result); // My name is John, I am 25 years old, and I enjoy playing football.\n```\n\n```\n// using string interpolation to concatenate strings\nString str1 = \"Dart\";\nString str2 = \"is fun\";\nString result = \"$str1 $str2!\";\nprint(result); // Dart is fun!\n``` \n\nNote that you can also use the \"concat\" method to concatenate strings, but it may not be as efficient as using the \"+\" operator.", "String_Interpolation": "Interpolation is the process of combining strings and values or expressions by embedding them in a string. Dart provides a convenient way to perform string interpolation using the \"$\" sign. The syntax of string interpolation in Dart is as follows:\n\n```\nString name = 'John';\nint age = 25;\nString s = '$name is $age years old.';\n```\n\nIn the above example, we have defined a string variable named \"s\" and assigned it the interpolated string. The interpolated string contains two variables, \"name\" and \"age\", which are enclosed in curly braces.\n\nDart also supports the use of expressions within interpolated strings. For example, we can use arithmetic operators to perform calculations within the string:\n\n```\nint x = 5;\nint y = 10;\nString s = 'The sum of $x and $y is ${x + y}.';\n```\n\nIn this example, we have used the \"${}\" syntax to embed an expression within the string. The expression inside the curly braces is evaluated at runtime and the result is then converted to a string and concatenated with the rest of the string.\n\nString interpolation can also be used to call functions or methods within the string:\n\n```\nString name = 'John';\nString s = 'The first letter of $name is ${name.substring(0, 1)}.';\n```\n\nIn this example, we have used the \"substring\" method of the \"String\" class to extract the first letter of the \"name\" variable and embed it within the string.\n\nIn conclusion, string interpolation in Dart is a powerful feature that makes it easy to concatenate strings and values or expressions. It provides a convenient and efficient way to create dynamic strings that can be used in various contexts.", "String_Remove_part": "In Dart, you can remove a part of a string using the `substring` method. \n\nThe `substring` method takes two parameters: the starting index and the ending index (optional). It returns a new string that contains the characters from the original string starting at the specified index and running up to (but not including) the ending index.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\n```\nString originalString = \"Hello, World!\";\n\n// Removing the first 7 characters of the string\nString newString = originalString.substring(7);\nprint(newString); // Output: \"World!\"\n\n// Removing a range of characters from the string\nnewString = originalString.substring(0, 5) + originalString.substring(7);\nprint(newString); // Output: \"Hello World!\"\n\n// Removing the last character of the string\nnewString = originalString.substring(0, originalString.length - 1);\nprint(newString); // Output: \"Hello, World\"\n```\n\nIn the first example, we removed the first 7 characters of the string using `substring(7)`.\n\nIn the second example, we removed a range of characters from the original string. We used `substring(0, 5)` to get the first 5 characters of the string and `substring(7)` to get all the characters after the 7th index. We then concatenated these two new strings using `+`.\n\nIn the third example, we removed the last character of the string. We used `substring(0, originalString.length - 1)` to get the characters from the start of the string up to (but not including) the last character.", "String_Replace": "To replace a substring within a string in Dart, you can use the `replaceAll()` method which takes two arguments: the substring to replace and the replacement string. Below are some examples:\n\nExample 1:\n```\nString originalString = \"Hello, world!\";\nString newString = originalString.replaceAll(\"world\", \"Dart\");\nprint(newString); // Hello, Dart!\n```\n\nIn the above example, we use the `replaceAll()` method to replace the substring \"world\" with \"Dart\" in the original string.\n\nExample 2:\n```\nString originalString = \"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.\";\nString newString = originalString.replaceAll(\"the\", \"A\");\nprint(newString); // A quick brown fox jumps over A lazy dog.\n```\n\nIn this example, we replace all occurrences of the substring \"the\" with the string \"A\" in the original string.\n\nExample 3:\n```\nString originalString = \"1243678\";\nString newString = originalString.replaceAll('6', '9');\nprint(newString); // 1243978\n```\n\nIn this example, we use the `replaceAll()` method to replace the substring \"6\" with \"9\" in the original string.\n\nThus, using the `replaceAll()` method, you can easily replace substrings within strings in Dart.", "String_Split": "In Dart, you can split a string into multiple substrings based on a specified separator or pattern. \n\nHere's an example of how to split a string using a separator:\n\n```dart\nString str = \"hello,world\";\n\nList<String> parts = str.split(\",\");\nprint(parts); // output: [\"hello\", \"world\"]\n```\n\nIn the example above, the `split()` method is used to split the string `str` into two separate strings using the separator `,`.\n\nIf you want to split a string based on a regular expression pattern, you can use the `split()` method with the regular expression pattern inside:\n\n```dart\nString str = \"hello@world.com\";\n\nList<String> parts = str.split(RegExp(r\"[@.]\"));\nprint(parts); // output: [\"hello\", \"world\", \"com\"]\n```\n\nIn this example, the `split()` method is used with a regular expression pattern that matches both `@` and `.` characters. As a result, the string is split into three substrings: `\"hello\"`, `\"world\"`, and `\"com\"`.", "String_Remove_leading_and_trailing_whitespace": "In Dart, you can remove leading and trailing whitespaces from a string using the `trim()` method. Here's an example:\n\n```\nString str = \"    Hello, World!   \";\nString trimmedStr = str.trim();\nprint(trimmedStr); // Output: \"Hello, World!\"\n```\n\nIn the above example, the original string \"    Hello, World!   \" contains leading and trailing whitespaces. The `trim()` method removes those whitespaces and returns the new string \"Hello, World!\".\n\nYou can also use `trimLeft()` and `trimRight()` methods to remove leading and trailing whitespaces respectively. Here's an example:\n\n```\nString str = \"    Hello, World!   \";\nString leftTrimmedStr = str.trimLeft();\nString rightTrimmedStr = str.trimRight();\nprint(leftTrimmedStr); // Output: \"Hello, World!   \"\nprint(rightTrimmedStr); // Output: \"    Hello, World!\"\n```\n\nIn the above example, the `trimLeft()` method removes leading whitespaces and returns the new string \"Hello, World!   \". Similarly, `trimRight()` method removes trailing whitespaces and returns the new string \"    Hello, World!\".", "String_Compare": "In Dart, you can compare two strings using the `==` operator. This operator returns `true` if both strings have the same sequence of characters, otherwise it returns `false`. Here are some examples:\n\n```dart\nvoid main() {\n  String str1 = \"Hello\";\n  String str2 = \"hello\";\n  String str3 = \"Hello\";\n  \n  // Case sensitive comparison using ==\n  print(str1 == str2); // false\n  print(str1 == str3); // true\n  \n  // Case insensitive comparison\n  print(str1.toLowerCase() == str2.toLowerCase()); // true\n  \n  // Compare using compareTo method\n  print(str1.compareTo(str2)); // positive value\n  print(str1.compareTo(str3)); // 0\n  print(str2.compareTo(str3)); // negative value\n}\n\n```\nIn the first example, we compare `str1` with `str2`. Since they have different cases, the result is `false`. In the second example, we compare `str1` with `str3`, which has the same sequence of characters but a different reference, the result is `true`. \n\nTo perform a case insensitive comparison, we can convert both strings to lowercase using the `toLowerCase()` method and then use the `==` operator to compare them.\n\nFinally, we can use the `compareTo()` method to compare two strings. This method compares the lexicographic (dictionary) order of two strings and returns a negative integer if the first string comes before the second string, a positive integer if it comes after, and 0 if they are equal.", "String_Regex": "Regular Expressions (regex) are a powerful tool used to match patterns in strings. In Dart, the `RegExp` class is used to define a regular expression pattern. Here is an example of defining a regular expression pattern:\n\n```dart\nRegExp pattern = RegExp(r'ab+c');\n```\n\nThis pattern will match any string that starts with an 'a', followed by one or more 'b's, and ends with a 'c'.\n\nTo use this pattern to match a string, we can call the `hasMatch()` method of the `RegExp` class, passing in the string we want to match:\n\n```dart\nbool matches = pattern.hasMatch('abbccc');\n\nprint(matches); // true\n```\n\nIn addition to the `hasMatch()` method, there are several other methods we can use to work with regular expressions:\n\n- `allMatches()` - returns an iterable of all matches in a string\n- `firstMatch()` - returns the first match in a string\n- `stringMatch()` - returns the matched string of the first match in a string\n\nHere is an example of using `allMatches()` to find all occurrences of a pattern in a string:\n\n```dart\nRegExp pattern = RegExp(r'\\d+');\nString text = 'There are 100 apples and 200 pears.';\n\nIterable<Match> matches = pattern.allMatches(text);\n\nfor (Match match in matches) {\n  print('${match.start} - ${match.end}: ${match.group(0)}');\n}\n```\n\nThis will output:\n\n```\n10 - 13: 100\n28 - 31: 200\n```\n\nIn this example, we're using the `\\d+` regular expression pattern to match one or more digits, and then calling the `allMatches()` method to find all occurrences of this pattern in the text. We then loop over each match and print out the start and end position of the match, as well as the matched string itself (which we get using the `group(0)` method of the `Match` object).\n\nRegular expressions can be complex, but they are also very powerful. They can be used to match a wide variety of patterns in strings, and Dart's `RegExp` class provides a simple way of incorporating regular expressions into your Dart code.", "Number_Increment": "In Dart, you can increment a number using the increment operator `++`. There are two types of increment operators: postfix and prefix.\n\n1. Postfix increment operator `n++` - adds 1 after the variable value is used.\n\n```\nint n = 5;\nprint(n++); // Output: 5\nprint(n); // Output: 6\n```\n\nIn the above example, the initial value of `n` is 5. When we print `n++`, it first prints the current value of `n` which is 5 and then increments `n` by 1. So, the value of `n` becomes 6 after the operation.\n\n2. Prefix increment operator `++n` - adds 1 before the variable value is used.\n\n```\nint n = 5;\nprint(++n); // Output: 6\nprint(n); // Output: 6\n```\n\nIn the above example, the initial value of `n` is 5. When we print `++n`, it first increments `n` by 1 and then prints the new value of `n` which is 6. So, the value of `n` remains 6 after the operation.", "Number_Compare": "In Dart, you can use the comparison operators to compare two numbers and produce a boolean result. \n\nThe comparison operators are:\n\n- `>` : Greater Than\n- `<` : Less Than\n- `>=`: Greater Than or Equal To\n- `<=`: Less Than or Equal To\n- `==`: Equality Check\n- `!=`: Not Equal To\n\nHere are some examples:\n\n```\nint x = 5;\nint y = 10;\n\nprint(x > y); // Output: false\nprint(x < y); // Output: true\nprint(x >= y); // Output: false\nprint(x <= y); // Output: true\nprint(x == y); // Output: false\nprint(x != y); // Output: true\n```\n\nIn the example above, we declared two variables `x` and `y` with initial values of `5` and `10` respectively. We then used the comparison operators to compare the values of the variables and printed the boolean result.\n\nIn the first comparison, `x` is not greater than `y`, so the output is `false`. In the second comparison, `x` is less than `y`, so the output is `true`. The same process applies to the other comparisons.", "Number_Random": "In Dart, you can generate random numbers using the `dart:math` library. The `Random()` method creates a `Random` object that you can use to generate random numbers.\n\nHere is an example:\n\n```dart\nimport 'dart:math';\n\nvoid main() {\n  var random = new Random();\n  \n  // generating a random integer\n  int randomInt = random.nextInt(10);\n  print('Random integer between 0 and 9: $randomInt');\n  \n  // generating a random double\n  double randomDouble = random.nextDouble();\n  print('Random double between 0.0 and 1.0: $randomDouble');\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, `random.nextInt(10)` generates a random integer between `0` and `9` (inclusive). `random.nextDouble()` generates a random double between `0.0` and `1.0` (exclusive).\n\nYou can also generate a random number within a specific range. Here is an example that generates a random integer between `1` and `100`:\n\n```dart\nimport 'dart:math';\n\nvoid main() {\n  var random = new Random();\n  \n  int min = 1;\n  int max = 100;\n  // generating a random integer between 1 and 100\n  int randomNumber = min + random.nextInt(max - min);\n  print('Random number between $min and $max: $randomNumber');\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, `randomNumber` will have a value between `1` and `100` (inclusive).", "Number_Float": "In Dart, floating-point numbers are represented using either the `double` or `float` data types. \n\nThe `double` data type is the default type used for floating-point numbers in Dart and is accurate up to 15 decimal digits. A `double` value is defined as follows:\n\n```\ndouble price = 12.99;\n```\n\nThe `float` data type, on the other hand, is less accurate and is accurate only up to 6 decimal digits. To use the `float` type, you need to import the `dart:typed_data` library. A `float` value is defined as follows:\n\n```\nimport 'dart:typed_data';\n\nFloat32 myFloat = 3.14159;\n```\n\nHere are some additional examples of using floating-point numbers in Dart:\n\n```\ndouble myDouble = 10.50;\nint myInt = 5;\n\n// Using a double variable in arithmetic expressions\nprint(myDouble + 3.5);\nprint(myDouble - 2.0);\n\n// Converting a double to an integer\nprint(myDouble.toInt());\n\n// Converting an integer to a double\nprint(myInt.toDouble());\n\n// Using a float variable in arithmetic expressions\nFloat32 myFloat = 2.345;\nprint(myFloat + 5.0);\nprint(myFloat - 2.0);\n\n// Converting a float to a double\nprint(myFloat.toDouble());\n``` \n\nIn the above examples, we show how to perform basic arithmetic operations on floating-point numbers, convert between data types, and perform type casting.", "Type_Get_type_of_object": "In Dart, we can get the type of an object using the `runtimeType` property or the `is` operator.\n\nHere's an example using `runtimeType`:\n\n```\nString word = \"hello\";\nprint(word.runtimeType); // Output: String\n```\n\nHere's an example using `is` operator:\n\n```\nint num = 10;\nif (num is int) {\n  print(\"num is an integer\");\n} else {\n  print(\"num is not an integer\");\n}\n```\n\nOutput: `num is an integer`\n\nBoth `runtimeType` and `is` operator can be used to check the type of an object dynamically during runtime.

We then create a new variable 'floatNum' and use the 'toDouble()' method to convert 'num' to a float. Finally, we print out the value of 'floatNum' to the console, which should give us the value '10.0'.\n\nYou can also convert an integer to a float when declaring the variable, like this:\n\n```dart\nvoid main() {\n  int num = 10;\n  double floatNum = 7/num;\n  print(floatNum);\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, we declare a variable 'floatNum' as a double and assign it the result of the operation '7/num', which is a float.

We then call the `int.parse()` method and pass `strNumber` as an argument. The method returns an integer value, which we store in the `integerValue` variable. Finally, we print the value of `integerValue` to the console.\n\nIt's important to note that if the string being converted is not a valid integer value, the `int.parse()` method will throw a `FormatException`. So it's a good idea to wrap the conversion in a try-catch block to handle any errors that may occur.

We then use the `contains()` method to check whether the array contains the integer 3 and 6, respectively. The `contains()` method returns `true` for the integer 3, and `false` for the integer 6.\n\nYou can also use the `contains()` method on arrays that contain other data types, like strings or objects. Here's an example that shows how to search for a string in an array of strings:\n\n```dart\nvoid main() {\n  List<String> animals = ['cat', 'dog', 'rat', 'bird'];\n  \n  print(animals.contains('dog')); // true\n  print(animals.contains('snake')); // false\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, we declare an array `animals` that contains four strings representing the names of animals. We then use the `contains()` method to check whether the array contains the string \"dog\" and \"snake\", respectively. The `contains()` method returns `true` for the string \"dog\", and `false` for the string \"snake\". \n\nSo, that's how you check if an array includes an element in Dart.", "Array_Iterate": "Sure. Iterating over an array means visiting every element of the array, one by one. In Dart, an array is known as a List. \n\nWe can use a for loop or a for-in loop to iterate over a List.\n\nHere's an example of a for loop to iterate over a List in Dart:\n\n```dart\nvoid main() {\n  var fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'orange'];\n  \n  for (var i = 0; i < fruits.length; i++) {\n    print(fruits[i]);\n  }\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, we first declare an array of fruits, which is a List object in Dart. We then use a for loop to iterate over the array. The for loop starts with the index 0 and continues until the index is less than the length of the array. Inside the loop, we print the value of the fruit at the current index.\n\nThe output of this program will be:\n\n```\napple\nbanana\norange\n```\n\nWe can also use a for-in loop to iterate over a List:\n\n```dart\nvoid main() {\n  var fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'orange'];\n  \n  for (var fruit in fruits) {\n    print(fruit);\n  }\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, we use a for-in loop to iterate over the array. The for loop assigns the value of each element in the List to the variable `fruit`. Inside the loop, we print the value of the fruit variable.\n\nThe output of this program will be the same as the previous program:\n\n```\napple\nbanana\norange\n```\n\nBoth of these examples demonstrate how to iterate over a List in Dart, using both a for loop and a for-in loop.", "Array_Iterate_with_index": "To iterate over an array with index in Dart, you can use a traditional for loop or a for-each loop with the `Iterable` class. Here are some examples:\n\n1.

We print both the index and the value of each element in the array.\n\n2. Using for-each loop with Iterable class:\n```\nvoid main() {\n  var arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];\n  \n  arr.asMap().forEach((index, value) => print(\"Index: $index, Value: $value\"));\n}\n```\nOutput:\n```\nIndex: 0, Value: 1\nIndex: 1, Value: 2\nIndex: 2, Value: 3\nIndex: 3, Value: 4\nIndex: 4, Value: 5\n```\nIn this example, we again declare an array `arr` but this time we use a for-each loop with the `Iterable` class. We use the `asMap()` method to iterate over the array and return both the index and the value of each element. The `forEach()` method is then called on the Iterable object to print out the index and value of each element in the array.", "Array_Get_first__last_element": "To get the first and last element of an array in Dart, you can use the `first` and `last` properties of the `List` class.\n\nHere's an example:\n\n```dart\nvoid main() {\n  List<int> numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];\n\n  int firstNumber = numbers.first;\n  int lastNumber = numbers.last;\n\n  print(\"First number: $firstNumber\"); // Output: First number: 1\n  print(\"Last number: $lastNumber\"); // Output: Last number: 5\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, we have a list of integers named `numbers`. We use the `first` and `last` properties to get the first and last elements of the list, respectively. We store these values in separate variables and then print them using the `print()` function. The output shows the first and last numbers in the list.", "Array_Find_first": "To find the first element of an array in Dart, you can use the `first` property.

We then use the `first` property to get the first element in the array and assign it to the variable `firstNumber`. We then print the value of `firstNumber`. The output will be `The first number in the array is 1`.", "Array_Select__find_all_": "In Dart, you can find all elements of an array satisfying a condition by using the `where` method, which allows you to filter the array based on a given condition. \n\nHere's an example:\n\n```dart\nvoid main() {\n  // create an array of integers\n  List<int> numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10];\n  \n  // find all even numbers using where method\n  List<int> evenNumbers = numbers.where((number) => number % 2 == 0).toList();\n\n  // print the even numbers\n  print(evenNumbers); // [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, we have an array of integers `numbers`. We use the `where` method to filter out only the even numbers. The `where` method takes a function that is called for each element in the array. If the function returns true, the element is included in the resulting array. In our example, the function `(number) => number % 2 == 0` returns true if the number is even. We call `toList()` method on the resulting iterable to convert it back to a List. Finally, we print out the resulting array of even numbers. \n\nYou can apply this approach to any type of array and any condition that you need to check.", "Array_Map__change_all_": "In Dart, you can change all elements of an array using a looping construct such as `for` loop or `forEach()` method.

We then iterate over each element of the array using a `for` loop. Inside the loop, we multiply current element by 2 and assign it to the same position in the array. Finally, we print the modified array `numbers`.\n\n2. Using `forEach()` method:\n\n```dart\nvoid main() {\n  List<int> numbers = [1, 2, 3];\n  numbers.forEach( (element) => element *= 10 );\n  print(numbers); // Output: [10, 20, 30]\n}\n```\n\nHere, we have initialized an array `numbers` with three integer values. We then call the `forEach()` method on the array and pass a lambda function as argument. The lambda function takes each element of the array, multiplies it by 10, and assigns the new value to the same position in the array. Finally, we print the modified array `numbers`.\n\nBoth approaches produce the same output. You can use any of these methods as per your preference and use case.", "Array_Concatenation": "In Dart, to concatenate two arrays, you can use the `+` operator. Here are examples:\n\nExample 1: Concatenating two numerical arrays\n```dart\nvoid main() {\n  List<int> first = [1, 2, 3];\n  List<int> second = [4, 5, 6];\n  List<int> combined = first + second;\n  print(combined); // Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]\n}\n```\n\nExample 2: Concatenating two string arrays\n```dart\nvoid main() {\n  List<String> first = ['hello', 'world'];\n  List<String> second = ['!', '!'];\n  List<String> combined = [...first, ...second];\n  print(combined); // Output: ['hello', 'world', '!', '!']\n}\n```\n\nIn the first example, we define two numerical arrays (`first` and `second`), concatenate them using the `+` operator, and save the result to a new variable `combined`. The output will be `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`.\n\nIn the second example, we define two string arrays (`first` and `second`), use the `spread operator (...)` to concatenate them, and save the result to a new variable `combined`. The output will be `['hello', 'world', '!', '!']`.", "Array_Sort": "Sure! In Dart, you can sort an array using the `sort()` method that is available for the `List` class. This method sorts the array in ascending order by default. Here is an example:\n\n```dart\nvoid main() {\n  List<int> numbers = [4, 1, 5, 2, 3];\n  numbers.sort();\n  print(numbers); // Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n}\n```\n\nAs you can see, we've created an array of integers called `numbers`. We then called the `sort()` method on the `numbers` array, which sorted the array in ascending order. Finally, we printed the sorted array using `print()`.\n\nIf you want to sort the array in descending order, you can use the `sort()` method in conjunction with the `compareTo()` method. Here is an example:\n\n```dart\nvoid main() {\n  List<int> numbers = [4, 1, 5, 2, 3];\n  numbers.sort((a, b) => b.compareTo(a));\n  print(numbers); // Output: [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, we've passed a function as a parameter to the `sort()` method. This function compares two values `a` and `b`, and returns -1, 0, or 1 depending on whether `a` is less than, equal to, or greater than `b`, respectively. By reversing the order of the values being compared (with `b.compareTo(a)`) we can sort the array in descending order.", "Array_Multidimensional": "In Dart, you can create a multidimensional array (an array of arrays) by nesting one or more arrays within an array. Here's an example of a two-dimensional array:\n\n```\nList<List<int>> myArray = [\n  [1, 2, 3],\n  [4, 5, 6],\n  [7, 8, 9],\n];\n```\n\nIn this example, `myArray` is a two-dimensional array of integers. The outer `List<List<int>>` specifies that `myArray` is a list of lists (i.e., two-dimensional), and that each element of the outer list is itself a list of integers.\n\nTo access an element of the array, you can use square brackets. For example, `myArray[1][2]` would give you the value `6`, since it refers to the third element (index 2) of the second inner array (index 1).\n\nTo initialise a multidimensional array, you can use a nested loop. Here's an example that creates a three-dimensional array of integers with dimensions 2x3x4:\n\n```\nList<List<List<int>>> myArray = List.generate(\n  2,\n  (i) => List.generate(\n    3,\n    (j) => List.generate(\n      4,\n      (k) => i + j + k,\n    ),\n  ),\n);\n```\n\nIn this example, we use the `List.generate()` method to create each level of the array. The outer level has size 2, the middle level has size 3, and the inner level has size 4. We use the loop variables `i`, `j`, and `k` to calculate the value of each element based on its indices.\n\nTo access an element of this array, you would need to use three sets of square brackets, like `myArray[1][2][3]`. This would give you the value `6`, since it refers to the fourth element (index 3) of the third inner array (index 2) of the second outer array (index 1).", "Array_Size": "In Dart, the `length` property can be used to get the size of an array. Here's an example:\n\n```dart\nvoid main() {\n  List<int> nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];\n  print(nums.length); // outputs 5\n}\n```\n\nIn the example above, we have an integer array `nums` with 5 elements. We get the size of the array using the `length` property and print it to the console.\n\nYou can also use the `isEmpty` property to check if an array is empty:\n\n```dart\nvoid main() {\n  List<String> fruits = [];\n  print(fruits.isEmpty); // outputs true\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, we have an empty string array `fruits`. We use the `isEmpty` property to check if the array is empty and print the result to the console. The output would be `true`, indicating that the array is indeed empty.", "Array_Count": "To count the number of elements in an array matching a condition in Dart, you can use the `where()` method to filter the list and then use the `length` property to get the number of matching elements.\n\nHere's an example:\n\n```dart\nvoid main() {\n  List<int> numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10];\n  \n  int countEven = numbers.where((number) => number % 2 == 0).length;\n  print('Total even numbers: $countEven'); // Output: Total even numbers: 5\n  \n  int countOdd = numbers.where((number) => number % 2 != 0).length;\n  print('Total odd numbers: $countOdd'); // Output: Total odd numbers: 5\n}\n```\n\nIn the above example, we have a list of 10 numbers. We use the `where()` method to filter the list based on whether the number is even or odd. Then we use the `length` property to get the number of elements that match the condition. Finally, we print the counts to the console.\n\nYou can modify the condition inside the `where()` method to count elements that satisfy any other condition.", "Array_Reduce": "In Dart, we can use the `reduce()` method to iterate over the elements of an iterable (such as an array or list) and reduce them to a single value. The `reduce()` method takes a function as an argument that combines two elements of the iterable into a single value. This function is called repeatedly until all elements have been combined into a single value. \n\nHere is an example of using `reduce()` to compute the sum of all the elements of an array:\n\n```\nvar numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];\nvar sum = numbers.reduce((a, b) => a + b);\nprint(sum);  // Output: 15\n```\n\nIn this example, `reduce()` is called on the `numbers` array. The function we pass to `reduce()` takes two arguments, `a` and `b`, which represent the accumulated value and the current value, respectively. The function adds `a` and `b` together and returns the result. This process is repeated until all elements of the array have been added together, resulting in the final sum of 15.\n\nHere is another example that uses `reduce()` to compute the product of all the elements of an array:\n\n```\nvar numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];\nvar product = numbers.reduce((a, b) => a * b);\nprint(product);  // Output: 120\n```\n\nIn this example, the same logic is applied, but instead of summing the elements, we multiply them together. The final product is 120. \n\nNote that `reduce()` can be used with any binary operation and iterables other than an array.", "Array_Index_of_element": "Sure, I'd be happy to explain.\n\nIn Dart, you can get the index of an element in an array using the `indexOf()` method. This method takes an argument, which is the element you want to find the index of, and returns the index of the first occurrence of that element in the array. If the element is not found in the array, the method returns -1.\n\nHere's an example:\n\n```dart\nvoid main() {\n  var arr = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50];\n  \n  // Finding the index of 30\n  var index = arr.indexOf(30);\n  print(\"The index of 30 is: $index\");  // Output: The index of 30 is: 2\n  \n  // Finding the index of 60 (not found)\n  index = arr.indexOf(60);\n  print(\"The index of 60 is: $index\");  // Output: The index of 60 is: -1\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, we have an array `arr` with 5 elements (10, 20, 30, 40, 50). We use the `indexOf()` method to find the index of the element 30, which is 2. We then try to find the index of the element 60, which is not present in the array, so the method returns -1.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.", "Array_Delete_element": "To delete an element from an array in Dart, we can make use of the `remove` or `removeAt` method of the `List` class.\n\nHere's an example code:\n\n```dart\nvoid main() {\n  List<String> animals = ['Cat', 'Dog', 'Elephant', 'Giraffe', 'Lion'];\n  \n  print('Before deleting: $animals');\n  \n  // Deleting by value using \"remove\" method\n  animals.remove('Elephant');\n  \n  // Deleting by index using \"removeAt\" method\n  animals.removeAt(3);\n  \n  print('After deleting: $animals');\n}\n```\n\nOutput:\n```\nBefore deleting: [Cat, Dog, Elephant, Giraffe, Lion]\nAfter deleting: [Cat, Dog, Giraffe]\n```\n\nIn the above example, we have first printed the original list using `print('Before deleting: $animals');`. \n\nThen, we have deleted an element from the list by value using the `remove` method shown below.\n\n```dart\nanimals.remove('Elephant');\n```\n\nNext, we have deleted an element from the list by index using the `removeAt` method shown below.\n\n```dart\nanimals.removeAt(3);\n```\n\nFinally, we have printed the list after deleting the elements using `print('After deleting: $animals');`.", "Array_Unique": "To get the unique elements of an array in Dart, you can use the `toSet()` method which converts the array into a set, removing all duplicate elements.

We accessed the value of a key using the square brackets `[]`. We added a new key-value pair using the square brackets `[]` and the assignment operator `=`. Finally, we printed the hash using `print()`.", "Hash__map__Add": "To add an element to a hash (also known as a map) in Dart, you can use the following syntax:\n\n```\nmyMap[key] = value;\n```\n\nHere, `myMap` is the name of the map, `key` is the key for the element you want to add, and `value` is the value you want to assign to the key.

Then, we add an element to it using the `[]` syntax with the key `\"name\"` and the value `\"John\"`. Finally, we print out the map to the console. The output should be `{'name': 'John'}`.", "Hash__map__Iterate": "In Dart, you can iterate over a map, which is equivalent to a hash in other languages.

Then we get the value of the key `'Sarah'` using square brackets notation and assign it to a variable called `sarahAge`. Finally, we print the value of `sarahAge`, which should output `30`.\n\nIt is important to note that if the key does not exist in the map, then Dart will return `null`. So, you can add check for null before using the value of a key.

Assigning a boolean value:\n\n```\nbool isRaining = true;\n```\nIn this example, we are declaring a boolean variable called `isRaining` and assigning a value of `true` to it.\n\n2. Using a boolean in a conditional statement:\n```\nif (isRaining) {\n  print('Please take an umbrella!');\n} else {\n  print('Enjoy the sunshine!');\n}\n```\nIn this example, we are using the `isRaining` variable in an if-else statement to print a message based on whether it is raining or not.\n\n3. Logical operators with booleans:\n```\nbool isSunny = false;\nbool isWarm = true;\n\nif (isSunny && isWarm) {\n  print('It is a beautiful day!');\n}\n```\nIn this example, we are using the `&&` (logical AND) operator to check if both `isSunny` and `isWarm` are true. If they are, we print a message saying it's a beautiful day.\n\n4. Comparing two boolean values:\n```\nbool isSummer = true;\nbool isWinter = false;\n\nif (isSummer == !isWinter) {\n  print('The seasons are not the same!');\n}\n```\nIn this example, we are using the `==` (equality) and `!` (logical NOT) operators to compare the values of `isSummer` and `isWinter`. If they are not the same, we print a message.\n\nThese are just a few examples of using boolean in Dart. Booleans are an important and useful data type in programming, and it's important for developers to understand how to use them effectively.", "Other_structure_Constant": "In Dart, a `constant` is a variable whose value cannot be changed once it is assigned. Constants are useful when you want to ensure that a value never changes throughout the execution of your program. \n\nHere are some examples of how to use constants in Dart:\n\n1. Declaring a constant integer:\n\n```\nconst int num = 10;\n```\n\nHere, `num` is a constant integer whose value is `10`.\n\n2. Declaring a constant string:\n\n```\nconst String message = \"Hello, world!\";\n```\n\nHere, `message` is a constant string whose value is `\"Hello, world!\"`.\n\n3. Using a constant in an expression:\n\n```\nconst int a = 5;\nconst int b = 10;\nconst int result = a + b;\n\nprint(result); // Output: 15\n```\n\nHere, `a` and `b` are constants, and we use them in an expression to compute the value of `result`.\n\n4.

Since the value of `number` is 2, the second case is executed and the corresponding message is printed.\n\nExample 2: Using switch with enum\n\n```dart\nenum Meal { breakfast, lunch, dinner }\n\nvoid main() {\n  Meal meal = Meal.lunch;\n\n  switch (meal) {\n    case Meal.breakfast:\n      print(\"I am having breakfast\");\n      break;\n    case Meal.lunch:\n      print(\"I am having lunch\");\n      break;\n    case Meal.dinner:\n      print(\"I am having dinner\");\n      break;\n  }\n}\n```\n\nOutput: `I am having lunch`\n\nExplanation: Here, we have an enum `Meal` which has three possible values - `breakfast`, `lunch`, and `dinner`. The variable `meal` is being compared to these three values using a switch statement. Since the value of `meal` is `lunch`, the corresponding message is printed.\n\nExample 3: Using switch with multiple cases\n\n```dart\nvoid main() {\n  String fruit = \"apple\";\n\n  switch (fruit) {\n    case \"apple\":\n    case \"banana\":\n    case \"orange\":\n      print(\"This is a fruit\");\n      break;\n    case \"carrot\":\n    case \"broccoli\":\n    case \"tomato\":\n      print(\"This is a vegetable\");\n      break;\n    default:\n      print(\"This is not a fruit or a vegetable\");\n  }\n}\n```\n\nOutput: `This is a fruit`\n\nExplanation: Here, we have a variable `fruit` which is being compared to multiple cases using a switch statement. Since the value of `fruit` is `apple`, which is one of the possible cases, the corresponding message is printed.

Increment/Decrement: Increases or decreases the loop counter variable.\n\nA `step` in a `for` loop refers to the change in the loop counter variable on each iteration.\n\nHere's an example of using step in a `for` loop in Dart. This loop prints odd numbers from 1 to 10:\n\n```\nfor (int i = 1; i <= 10; i += 2) {\n  print(i);\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, the `i` variable is initialized to 1, and then iterates until it is equal to or greater than 10. On each iteration, the `i` variable is increased by 2 using the `i += 2` syntax. This means that the loop only prints odd numbers from 1 to 10.\n\nAnother example of using `for` loop with step can be to print the multiples of a given number:\n\n```\nint num = 3; // print multiples of 3\nfor (int i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {\n  int multiple = num * i;\n  print(multiple);\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, the loop initializes the `i` variable to 1 and iterates until it is equal to or greater than 10. On each iteration, it calculates the `multiple` of `num` by multiplying it with `i`. The loop then prints this `multiple`.

And we declare the returned value to be of type `List<int>`, which indicates that we are returning an integer array.\n\nNote that we can also use the `var` keyword to define the type dynamically:\n\n```\nList<String> getNames() {\n  return [\"Alice\", \"Bob\", \"Charlie\"];\n}\n\nvoid main() {\n  var names = getNames();\n  print(names); // Output: [Alice, Bob, Charlie]\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, we use the `var` keyword, and Dart is able to infer that the `getNames()` function is returning a `List<String>`.

It can be used to create functions with a persistent variable state, to pass functions as arguments to other functions, or to return functions from functions.\n\nHere is an example of closure in Dart:\n\n```dart\nFunction counter() {\n  int count = 0;\n  return () {\n    count++;\n    print(count);\n  };\n}\n\nvoid main() {\n  var c = counter();\n  c(); // prints 1\n  c(); // prints 2\n  c(); // prints 3\n}\n```\n\nIn the above example, the `counter()` function returns an inner anonymous function that can access the `count` variable in the outer scope. Each time the returned function is called, the value of `count` is incremented and printed.\n\nHere is another example that demonstrates how closure can be used to create a function with a persistent variable state:\n\n```dart\nFunction add(int x) {\n  return (int y) => x + y;\n}\n\nvoid main() {\n  var add5 = add(5);\n  var add10 = add(10);\n  print(add5(3)); // prints 8\n  print(add10(3)); // prints 13\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, the `add()` function returns a nested function that adds the given argument to a persistent variable `x`. The `add5` and `add10` variables hold function objects that have a different value for `x`, i.e., 5 and 10 respectively. When these functions are called with an argument, they add the argument to the respective value of `x`.\n\nIn summary, closure in Dart is a powerful feature that enables the creation of function objects with a persistent state and the ability to access variables in their lexical scope.", "Method___Function_Block_passing": "In Dart, block passing refers to passing a block of code as a parameter to a function or method. There are two main ways to use block passing in Dart:\n\n1. Anonymous functions as parameters:\nAn anonymous function is a function without a name, and it can be used as a parameter to another function. The syntax for using an anonymous function is:\n\n```\nfunctionName((parameters) {\n  // block of code\n});\n```\n\nFor example:\n\n```\nvoid main() {\n  var myList = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];\n  var doubled = myList.map((number) => number * 2);\n  print(doubled);  // output: (2, 4, 6, 8, 10)\n}\n```\n\nIn the above example, we are passing an anonymous function to the `map()` method of the `myList` object. The anonymous function takes a parameter `number` and returns the doubled value of the number.\n\n2. Function literals:\nFunction literals are a shorthand way of writing anonymous functions, and they can also be used as parameters to other functions. The syntax for using a function literal is:\n\n```\nfunctionName((parameters) => expression);\n```\n\nFor example:\n\n```\nvoid main() {\n  var myList = [5, 10, 15, 20];\n  var total = myList.fold(0, (sum, number) => sum + number);\n  print(total);  // output: 50\n}\n```\n\nIn the above example, we are passing a function literal to the `fold()` method of `myList`. The function literal takes two parameters `sum` and `number`, and returns their sum. The `fold()` method uses this function to calculate the total sum of the elements in `myList`.\n\nIn summary, block passing in Dart gives us the flexibility to pass blocks of code as parameters to functions and methods, allowing us to write more concise and expressive code.", "Method___Function_Block_binding": "Block binding in Dart allows developers to create variables that are scoped to certain blocks of code, which can help prevent variable name collisions and improve code readability. \n\nTo use block binding, developers can use curly braces `{}` to define a block of code, and then declare variables within that block using the `var` or `final` keyword.\n\nHere is an example:\n\n```\nvoid main() {\n  print('Start');\n\n  {\n    var message = 'Hello world';\n    print(message);\n  }\n\n  {\n    final name = 'Alice';\n    print('Hello $name');\n  }\n\n  print('End');\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, we have two blocks of code, one with a `var` variable and one with a `final` variable. These variables are scoped to their respective blocks and cannot be accessed outside of them.\n\nThe output of this code would be:\n\n```\nStart\nHello world\nHello Alice\nEnd\n```\n\nOverall, block binding in Dart is a powerful feature that can help developers write well-scoped and organized code.", "Method___Function_Initialize_in_runtime": "In Dart, you can initialize a method or function at runtime using closures. A closure is a function object that has access to variables in its lexical scope, even when the function is invoked outside that scope. Closures are often used to implement callbacks and event handlers.\n\nHere's an example of defining a closure:\n\n```dart\ntypedef MathFunction = int Function(int, int);\n\nvoid main() {\n  // Create a closure by defining a function inside another function\n  MathFunction add = (int a, int b) {\n    return a + b;\n  };\n\n  // Use the closure to add two numbers\n  int result = add(3, 5);\n  print(result); // Output: 8\n\n  // You can also pass closures as arguments to other functions\n  int compute(MathFunction operation, int a, int b) {\n    return operation(a, b);\n  }\n\n  int sum = compute(add, 3, 5);\n  print(sum); // Output: 8\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, we define a closure named `add` that takes two integers as parameters and returns their sum. We then use this closure to compute the sum of 3 and 5.\n\nWe also define a function named `compute` that takes a closure as its first argument, along with two integers. The function applies the closure to the integers and returns the result.\n\nUsing closures is a powerful and flexible way to initialize methods and functions at runtime in Dart.", "Method___Function_Alias": "Aliases in Dart allow us to provide an alternate name for an existing class or library, making our code more concise and readable. We can create aliases for import statements and type declarations.\n\nHere's an example of creating an alias for a library:\n\n```\n//original import statement\nimport 'package:flutter/material.dart';\n\n//alias import statement\nimport 'package:flutter/material.dart' as myAlias;\n\nvoid main() {\n  //original widget declaration\n  MaterialApp myApp = MaterialApp();\n  \n  //alias declaration\n  myAlias.MaterialApp myAliasApp = myAlias.MaterialApp();\n  \n  //using the original widget\n  runApp(myApp);\n  \n  //using the alias widget\n  runApp(myAliasApp);\n}\n```\n\nIn the code above, we created an alias (`myAlias`) for the `flutter/material.dart` library. Later, we used the alias to create an instance of the `MaterialApp` widget.\n\nWe can also use aliases for type declarations, like this:\n\n```\n//original type declaration\nvoid printInteger(int aNumber) {\n  print('The number is $aNumber.');\n}\n\n//alias type declaration\ntypedef IntFunction = void Function(int);\n\nvoid main() {\n  //using the original function declaration\n  printInteger(42);\n  \n  //using the alias function declaration\n  IntFunction myFunction = printInteger;\n  myFunction(42);\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, we created an alias (`IntFunction`) for the type `void Function(int)`. We then used the alias to create a variable (`myFunction`) that points to the `printInteger` function.\n\nBy using aliases, we can make our code easier to read and understand, especially when working with imported libraries or complex type declarations.", "Class_Declare": "In Dart, you can use the `class` keyword to declare a new class. Here's a simple example of a `Person` class:\n\n```dart\nclass Person {\n  String name;\n  int age;\n\n  Person(this.name, this.age);\n\n  void introduceYourself() {\n    print(\"My name is $name and I am $age years old.\");\n  }\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, the `Person` class has two properties (a `name` and an `age`) and a constructor that sets these properties when a new `Person` object is created. It also has a method `introduceYourself()` that prints the `name` and `age` of the `Person` object to the console.\n\nYou can use this class to create new `Person` objects like this:\n\n```dart\nvoid main() {\n  var person = Person(\"John\", 25);\n  person.introduceYourself(); // prints \"My name is John and I am 25 years old.\"\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, we create a new `Person` object named `person`, with a `name` of \"John\" and an `age` of 25. We then call the `introduceYourself()` method on the `person` object, which prints its `name` and `age` to the console.", "Class_Constructor": "In Dart, a constructor is a special method used to create and initialize objects within a class. Constructors have the same name as the class and can be used to set default values for object properties or perform other operations when the object is created.\n\nThere are two types of constructors in Dart:\n\n1. Default Constructor: It is automatically generated by Dart when there is no constructor available in the class. It does not take any arguments and initializes the object with default values.\n\nExample:\n\n```dart\nclass Student {\n  String name;\n  int age;\n\n  Student() {\n    name = 'No Name';\n    age = 0;\n  }\n}\n\nvoid main() {\n  Student s = new Student();\n  print('Name: ${s.name}');\n  print('Age: ${s.age}');\n}\n```\n\nIn the above example, we created a `Student` class with a default constructor that initializes the object with default values. We then created an object of the `Student` class and printed its properties.\n\nOutput:\n```\nName: No Name\nAge: 0\n```\n\n2. Parameterized Constructor: It is a constructor that takes one or more arguments to initialize object properties.\n\nExample:\n\n```dart\nclass Student {\n  String name;\n  int age;\n\n  Student(String n, int a) {\n    name = n;\n    age = a;\n  }\n}\n\nvoid main() {\n  Student s = new Student('John', 21);\n  print('Name: ${s.name}');\n  print('Age: ${s.age}');\n}\n```\n\nIn the above example, we created a `Student` class with a parameterized constructor that takes two arguments `n` and `a` to initialize object properties. We then created an object of the `Student` class with the values 'John' and 21 and printed its properties.\n\nOutput:\n```\nName: John\nAge: 21\n```\n\nAlternatively, constructors can also be defined using the shorthand syntax that uses `this` keyword to initialize object properties.\n\nExample:\n\n```dart\nclass Student {\n  String name;\n  int age;\n\n  Student(this.name, this.age);\n}\n\nvoid main() {\n  Student s = new Student('John', 21);\n  print('Name: ${s.name}');\n  print('Age: ${s.age}');\n}\n```\n\nIn the above example, we created a `Student` class with a parameterized constructor using shorthand syntax that initializes the `name` and `age` properties using `this` keyword. We then created an object of the `Student` class with the values 'John' and 21 and printed its properties.\n\nOutput:\n```\nName: John\nAge: 21\n```", "Class_Method_call": "In Dart, you can call a method in a class by creating an object of that class and using that object to call the method.\n\nHere's an example of a simple class with a method:\n\n```dart\nclass Rectangle {\n  int width;\n  int height;\n  \n  Rectangle(this.width, this.height);\n  \n  int calculateArea() {\n    return width * height;\n  }\n}\n```\n\nTo call the `calculateArea()` method of this class, you first need to create an object of the `Rectangle` class:\n\n```dart\nRectangle myRectangle = Rectangle(5, 3);\n```\n\nThis creates a new instance of the `Rectangle` class and sets the `width` to 5 and the `height` to 3.\n\nNow you can call the `calculateArea()` method using the object you just created:\n\n```dart\nint area = myRectangle.calculateArea();\n```\n\nThis will call the `calculateArea()` method on the `myRectangle` object and return the area (which in this case is 15). \n\nYou can also call the method directly on the object using the dot notation:\n\n```dart\nint area = myRectangle.calculateArea;\n```\n\nBoth of these methods will give you the same result.", "Class_Static_method": "Sure, I would love to explain how to define a static method in a class in Dart.\n\nStatic methods in Dart are declared using the `static` keyword. They are called on the class, rather than on an instance of the class. Static methods can be used for utility or helper functions that do not depend on any instance variables, and they are useful when you need to use a method in a class without creating an instance of that class.\n\nHere is an example of how to define a static method in a class in Dart:\n\n```dart\nclass MathUtils {\n  static int addNumbers(int x, int y) {\n    return x + y;\n  }\n}\n\nvoid main() {\n  // call the static method directly on the class\n  int sum = MathUtils.addNumbers(5, 10);\n  print(sum); // output: 15\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, we have defined a `MathUtils` class with a static method called `addNumbers`. This method takes two integer parameters `x` and `y`, adds them together, and returns their sum. \n\nTo call the `addNumbers` method, we don't need to create an object of `MathUtils`. We can call the method directly on the class by using the class name followed by the method name. \n\nIn the `main()` function, we are calling the `addNumbers` method with the parameters `5` and `10`, which returns `15`. We store this value in a variable called `sum` and print it to the console.\n\nI hope that clarifies how to define a static method in a class in Dart. Let me know if you have any questions!", "Class_Private_method": "In Dart, private methods and variables can be defined using an underscore prefix before the name. Private methods can only be accessed within the same dart library. Here is an example of how to define and use a private method in Dart:\n\n```\nclass ExampleClass {\n  String _privateMethod() {\n    // private method definition\n    return \"This is a private method.\";\n  }\n  \n  void publicMethod() {\n    // public method that calls private method\n    print(_privateMethod());\n  }\n}\n\nvoid main() {\n  ExampleClass example = ExampleClass();\n  example.publicMethod(); // Output: This is a private method.\n  \n  // This would produce an error as the private method can only be accessed within the same library\n  // print(example._privateMethod());\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, we have defined a private method `_privateMethod()` that returns a string. This private method can only be called within the same class or library and cannot be accessed from outside. We have also defined a public method `publicMethod()` that calls the private method. When we call the `publicMethod()`, It will call the `_privateMethod()`.\n", "Class_Private_method__access_instance_variable": "In Dart, instance variables can only be accessed within the class they are defined in. Private methods and variables in Dart are denoted by prefixing the identifier name with an underscore (_). Therefore, to access an instance variable in a private method in Dart, you can simply use the variable name within the private method.\n\nHere is an example code snippet demonstrating how to access an instance variable within a private method in Dart:\n\n```\nclass Person {\n  String _name;\n  \n  void _privateMethod() {\n    print('My name is $_name');\n  }\n  \n  void setName(String name) {\n    _name = name;\n    _privateMethod();\n  }\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, the private method `_privateMethod()` accesses the private instance variable `_name` using the `_name` identifier within the method body. This method is called within the `setName()` public method, which sets the value of the `_name` variable and then calls `_privateMethod()` to print the value of the variable.\n\nNote that you cannot access private variables or methods of another class, even if they are inherited by a child class.", "Class_Field": "In Dart, fields are used to represent the characteristics or properties of a class. Fields can be either instance variables or class variables. \n\nInstance variables are fields that belong to instances of a class. They can have individual values for each object created from the class. Class variables, on the other hand, belong to the class itself and are shared by all instances of the class.\n\nHere's an example of using instance variables in a class:\n\n```dart\nclass Car {\n  String make;\n  String model;\n  int year;\n\n  Car(String make, String model, int year) {\n    this.make = make;\n    this.model = model;\n    this.year = year;\n  }\n  \n  void printCarInfo() {\n    print('Make: $make, Model: $model, Year: $year');\n  }\n}\n\nvoid main() {\n  Car myCar = new Car('Toyota', 'Corolla', 2015);\n  myCar.printCarInfo();\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, the `Car` class has three instance variables: `make`, `model`, and `year`. These variables are assigned values using the constructor when a new object is created. The `printCarInfo()` method is used to print the values of these fields for an instance of the class.\n\nNow let's look at an example of using class variables in a class:\n\n```dart\nclass Counter {\n  static int count = 0;\n\n  void incrementCount() {\n    count++;\n  }\n\n  void printCount() {\n    print('Count: $count');\n  }\n}\n\nvoid main() {\n  Counter c1 = new Counter();\n  c1.incrementCount();\n  c1.printCount();\n\n  Counter c2 = new Counter();\n  c2.incrementCount();\n  c2.printCount();\n  \n  // Output:\n  // Count: 1\n  // Count: 2\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, the `Counter` class has a static class variable called `count`. This variable is shared by all instances of the class. The `incrementCount()` method is used to increment the `count` field for a `Counter` object, and the `printCount()` method is used to print the value of the `count` field for any `Counter` object. When two `Counter` objects are created and `incrementCount()` is called on each, the `printCount()` method shows that the `count` field has been incremented for both objects.\n\nIn summary, fields in Dart are a way to represent the characteristics or properties of a class, using either instance variables or class variables, depending on whether the field should be unique to each object or shared by all objects of the class.", "Class_Get_set": "In Dart, we can define a class and its properties using getters and setters. Here are some examples of how to use get/set in a class:\n\n1. Basic Getter and Setter:\n\n```dart\nclass Person {\n  String _name;\n\n  String get name => _name;\n\n  set name(String value) => _name = value;\n}\n\nvoid main() {\n  final person = Person();\n  person.name = 'John Doe';\n  print(person.name); // Output: 'John Doe'\n}\n```\n\nIn the above example, the `Person` class has a private property `_name`. The `name` getter returns the value of `_name`, and the `name` setter sets the value of `_name`.\n\n2. Computed Properties:\n\n```dart\nclass Rectangle {\n  double _width;\n  double _height;\n\n  double get area => _width * _height;\n\n  set width(double value) => _width = value;\n  set height(double value) => _height = value;\n}\n\nvoid main() {\n  final rectangle = Rectangle();\n  rectangle.width = 5;\n  rectangle.height = 10;\n  print(rectangle.area); // Output: 50\n}\n```\n\nIn the above example, the `Rectangle` class has private properties `_width` and `_height`. The `area` getter calculates the area of the rectangle based on `_width` and `_height`. The `width` and `height` setters set the values of `_width` and `_height`.\n\n3. Read-Only Properties:\n\n```dart\nclass Circle {\n  final double radius;\n\n  Circle(this.radius);\n\n  double get area => math.pi * math.pow(radius, 2);\n}\n\nvoid main() {\n  final circle = Circle(5);\n  print(circle.area); // Output: 78.53981633974483\n}\n```\n\nIn the above example, the `Circle` class has a read-only property `radius`, which is set in the constructor. The `area` getter calculates the area of the circle based on `radius`.\n\nOverall, getters and setters provide flexibility and encapsulation in object-oriented programming and are essential tools for class design in Dart.", "Class_Inheritance": "Inheritance is a feature of object-oriented programming that allows developers to create a new class from an existing one.

It also has a method for starting the engine.\n\nThen we have an `ElectricCar` class that extends the `Car` class. It adds a property for the battery capacity and a method for charging the battery.\n\nWhen we create an instance of the `ElectricCar` class and set the properties, we can call the `startEngine` method from the parent class. We can also call the `chargeBattery` method from the child class.\n\nInheritance is useful for minimizing code duplication, as well as creating a hierarchy of classes that share common functionality.", "Class_Mixin": "In Dart, a mixin is a way to reuse a class's code in multiple class hierarchies. \n\nA mixin adds functionality to a class without creating a subclass. \n\nTo use a mixin in Dart, you first have to define a mixin using the `mixin` keyword, followed by the mixin name and the code you want to include:\n\n```\nmixin MyMixin {\n  // code you want to include\n}\n```\n\nThen, you can use the `with` keyword to use the mixin in a class:\n\n```\nclass MyClass with MyMixin {\n  // class code\n}\n```\n\nHere is a more detailed example that demonstrates how to use a mixin in Dart:\n\n```\nmixin CanFly {\n  void fly() {\n    print('I can fly!');\n  }\n}\n\nclass Bird {\n  String name;\n\n  Bird(this.name);\n}\n\nclass Eagle extends Bird with CanFly {\n  Eagle(String name) : super(name);\n}\n\nvoid main() {\n  var eagle = Eagle('Golden eagle');\n  eagle.fly();  // Output: I can fly!\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, we defined a `CanFly` mixin that adds a `fly()` method. \n\nWe then created a `Bird` class and an `Eagle` subclass that extends from `Bird` and includes the `CanFly` mixin using the `with` keyword.\n\nFinally, we created an instance of the `Eagle` class and called the `fly()` method to demonstrate that the `CanFly` mixin was successfully included in the class.", "Class_Has_method_": "In Dart, you can use the `hasOwnProperty` method to check whether a class has a specific method or not.

Then, we have created an instance of the `Shape` class and checked if it has a `draw` method using the `hasOwnProperty` method.

We assigned `null` to `a` and `20` to `b`. We then used the null-aware assignment operator `??=` to assign 10 to `a` if it was null, and `30` to `b` if it was null. Since `a` was null, it got assigned the value 10, and `b` was not null, so it retained its value of 20.\n\nThis is a handy operator when you want to assign a default value to a variable that may or may not have been initialized.", "Other_Import_another_file": "In Dart, you can import code from another file using the `import` keyword.

The first file, `file1.dart`, defines a function `printMessage()` that prints a message to the console. The `main.dart` file imports the `file1.dart` file using the `import` keyword and calls the `printMessage()` function.\n\nNote that when importing a file, you can either specify a relative or an absolute path. In the example above, we specified a relative path to import `file1.dart`. \n\nYou can also use the `show` and `hide` keywords to control which specific parts of the imported file you want to use. Here is an example:\n\n```dart\n// file2.dart\nvoid printMessage() {\n  print('Hello, World!');\n}\n\nvoid printName() {\n  print('My name is Dart!');\n}\n```\n\n```dart\n// main.dart\nimport 'file2.dart' hide printMessage;\n\nvoid main() {\n  printName(); // calls the printName() function from file2.dart\n  printMessage(); // Error: printMessage is not defined\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, the `main.dart` file imports the `file2.dart` file and uses the `hide` keyword to exclude the `printMessage()` function from being imported.

Destructuring assignment with nested objects\n```\nvar person = {\"name\": \"John Doe\", \"age\": 30, \"address\": {\"city\": \"New York\", \"state\": \"NY\"}};\nvar {name, age, address: {city, state}} = person;\n\nprint(name); // John Doe\nprint(age); // 30\nprint(city); // New York\nprint(state); // NY\n```\n\n4. Destructuring assignment with default values\n```\nvar person = {\"name\": \"John Doe\", \"age\": 30};\nvar {name, age, email = \"unknown\"} = person;\n\nprint(name); // John Doe\nprint(age); // 30\nprint(email); // unknown\n```\n\n5. Destructuring assignment with function parameters\n```\nvoid foo({String name, int age}) {\n  print(name);\n  print(age);\n}\n\nfoo(name: \"John Doe\", age: 30);\n```\n\nYou can also use destructuring assignment to extract values directly from function parameters:\n```\nvoid foo({String name, int age}) {\n  var {firstName, lastName} = name.split(\" \");\n  print(firstName);\n  print(lastName);\n  print(age);\n}\n\nfoo(name: \"John Doe\", age: 30);\n```\n\nThese are just some examples of how to use destructuring assignment in Dart. Overall, destructuring assignment can make your code more concise and easier to read when working with objects and arrays.", "Other_Date": "In Dart, you can use the `DateTime` class to work with dates and times. Here are some examples of how to use `DateTime`:\n\n1. Create a `DateTime` object representing the current date and time:\n```\nDateTime now = DateTime.now();\n```\n\n2. Create a `DateTime` object for a specific date and time:\n```\nDateTime myBirthday = DateTime(1990, 6, 2, 12);\n```\n\n3. Convert a `DateTime` object to a string representation:\n```\nDateTime now = DateTime.now();\nString dateString = now.toString();\nprint(dateString); // Output: 2022-08-23 21:45:00.123456\n```\n\n4. Get the year, month, day, hour, minute, or second from a `DateTime` object:\n```\nDateTime now = DateTime.now();\nint year = now.year;\nint month = now.month;\nint day = now.day;\nint hour = now.hour;\nint minute = now.minute;\nint second = now.second;\n```\n\n5. Perform arithmetic on `DateTime` objects:\n```\nDateTime now = DateTime.now();\nDateTime tomorrow = now.add(Duration(days: 1));\nDateTime yesterday = now.subtract(Duration(days: 1));\n```\n\n6. Compare `DateTime` objects:\n```\nDateTime now = DateTime.now();\nDateTime later = DateTime.now().add(Duration(hours: 1));\nbool isBefore = now.isBefore(later);\nbool isAfter = now.isAfter(later);\n```\n\nThese are just some of the ways you can use `DateTime`. There are many more methods and properties available on the `DateTime` class that you can use to work with dates and times in your Dart code.", "Other_Time": "In Dart, time is managed through the `DateTime` class, which represents a date and time value.

Create a specific date and time:\n\n```\nDateTime date = DateTime(2022, 12, 31, 23, 59, 59);\nprint(date);\n```\n\n3. Convert a timestamp to a `DateTime`:\n\n```\nDateTime date = DateTime.fromMillisecondsSinceEpoch(1640995200000);\nprint(date);\n```\n\n4. Get the difference between two dates as a duration:\n\n```\nDateTime date1 = DateTime(2022, 12, 31);\nDateTime date2 = DateTime(2023, 1, 1);\nDuration difference = date2.difference(date1);\nprint(difference);\n```\n\n5.

This means that if a boolean value is true, using \"!\" before it will reverse its value to false, and vice versa.\n\nHere are some examples of using \"not\" in Dart:\n\n```dart\nbool isSunny = true;\nprint(!isSunny); // Outputs false - the opposite of true\n\nbool hasCookies = false;\nprint(!hasCookies); // Outputs true - the opposite of false\n```\n\nYou can also use \"not\" with comparison operators, like the following:\n\n```dart\nint number = 10;\nprint(number != 5); // Outputs true - 10 is not equal to 5\n```\n\nIn this case, \"!=\" means \"not equal to\", so the expression is true because \"number\" is indeed not equal to 5.", "Other_Assign_this_or_that": "In Dart, you can use the conditional operator `?` : `:` to assign values based on a condition. This is often referred to as the ternary operator. \n\nThe syntax for the ternary operator is:\n\n```\ncondition ? expression1 : expression2;\n```\n\nIf `condition` is true, `expression1` is executed and assigned to the variable. If `condition` is false, `expression2` is executed and assigned to the variable. \n\nHere's an example: \n\n```\nbool isTrue = true;\n\nString value = isTrue ? 'This' : 'That';\n\nprint(value); // output: This\n```\n\nIn this example, the `isTrue` variable is set to `true`. When we use the ternary operator to assign a value to the `value` variable, it checks if `isTrue` is true. Since it is, it assigns the string 'This' to the `value` variable. \n\nLet's take a look at another example: \n\n```\nbool isTrue = false;\n\nString value = isTrue ? 'This' : 'That';\n\nprint(value); // output: That\n```\n\nIn this example, `isTrue` is set to `false`. When we use the ternary operator to assign a value to the `value` variable, it checks if `isTrue` is true.
