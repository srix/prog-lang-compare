In Go, the `len()` function can be used to get the size or length of a hash. Here's an example code snippet that shows how to get the size of a hash in Go:

```
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    // Create a hash
    myHash := make(map[string]string)
    myHash["one"] = "uno"
    myHash["two"] = "dos"
    myHash["three"] = "tres"

    // Get the size of the hash
    size := len(myHash)

    // Print the size of the hash
    fmt.Println("Size of the hash:", size)
}
```

This code creates a hash using the `make()` function and adds some key-value pairs to it. Then, the `len()` function is used to get the size of the hash, which is stored in the `size` variable. Finally, the size of the hash is printed to the console using `fmt.Println()`.
