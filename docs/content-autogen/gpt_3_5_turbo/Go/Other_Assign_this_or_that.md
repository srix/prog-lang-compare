In Go, "this or that" is typically represented using conditional statements, such as "if-else" or "switch-case". These statements allow you to choose between multiple options based on certain conditions.

Here's an example of using an "if-else" statement to assign a value to a variable based on a condition:

```
package main
  
import "fmt"
  
func main() {
    x := 10
    var y string
  
    if x > 5 {
        y = "this"
    } else {
        y = "that"
    }
  
    fmt.Println(y)
}
```

In this example, we declare a variable `x` and assign it the value 10 and another empty variable `y`. Then, we use an "if-else" statement to check if `x` is greater than 5. If it is, we assign the value "this" to `y`, otherwise we assign the value "that". The final output will be "this" since `x` is greater than 5.

Here's an example of using a "switch-case" statement to assign a value to a variable based on a condition:

```
package main
  
import "fmt"
  
func main() {
    x := 2
    var y string
  
    switch x {
    case 1:
        y = "this"
    case 2:
        y = "that"
    default:
        y = "neither this nor that"
    }
  
    fmt.Println(y)
}
```

In this example, we declare a variable `x` and assign it the value 2 and another empty variable `y`. Then, we use a "switch-case" statement to check the value of `x`. If `x` is 1, we assign the value "this" to `y`. If `x` is 2, we assign the value "that" to `y`. If `x` is anything else, we assign the value "neither this nor that" to `y`. The final output will be "that" since `x` is 2.
