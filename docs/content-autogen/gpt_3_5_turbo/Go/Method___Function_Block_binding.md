Go allows for block-level variable declaration and binding using the `:=` notation.

Here is an example of using block binding in Go:

```
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    x := 10
    fmt.Println("x =", x)

    if y := 5; x > y {
        fmt.Println("x is greater than y")
    } else {
        fmt.Println("y is greater than x")
    }
}
```

In the example above, we declare and bind the variable `x` to the value `10` using the `:=` notation. We also use the `:=` notation to declare and bind the variable `y` to the value `5` within the block of the `if` statement. This variable `y` is only accessible within the `if` statement's block. 

We then use `if-else` statement, comparing `x` and `y`, and print the result based on the comparison.

Block binding is useful when you need to declare a variable within a specific block of code and ensure that it is only accessible within that block. This can help avoid naming conflicts and ensure that variables are only used where they are intended to be used.
