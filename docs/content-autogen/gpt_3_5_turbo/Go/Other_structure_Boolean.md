In Go, a boolean is a data type that can hold only one of two values: true or false. Booleans are primarily used to test conditions or represent the truth state of a value.

Here's an example of declaring and initializing a boolean variable in Go:

```go
var isSunny bool = true
```

In this example, the variable `isSunny` is declared and initialized to the value `true` - indicating that it's sunny outside.

We can use boolean variables to make decisions in code using conditionals. For example:

```go
if isSunny {
    fmt.Println("It's sunny!")
} else {
    fmt.Println("It's not sunny.")
}
```

This code prints "It's sunny!" if `isSunny` is true, and "It's not sunny." if `isSunny` is false.

We can also use boolean operators to combine multiple boolean values or negate them. Here are some common boolean operators in Go:

- `&&` (and) - returns `true` if both operands are `true`, otherwise returns `false`
- `||` (or) - returns `true` if at least one of the operands is `true`, otherwise returns `false`
- `!` (not) - negates (flips) the value of the operand (i.e. if it was `true`, it becomes `false` and vice versa)

Here's an example that uses boolean operators to check if it's both sunny and hot outside:

```go
var isHot bool = true

if isSunny && isHot {
    fmt.Println("It's hot and sunny!")
} else {
    fmt.Println("It's not that hot or sunny.")
}
```

This code prints "It's hot and sunny!" if `isSunny` and `isHot` are both `true`, and "It's not that hot or sunny." otherwise.

Overall, booleans are a simple yet powerful tool for representing the truth state of values and making conditional decisions in Go.
