Certainly! Converting an integer to a string in Ruby is very easy to do. You can do this using the `to_s` method built into Ruby, which converts any object to a string.

Here are examples of how you can convert an integer to a string in Ruby:

```ruby
x = 123
str = x.to_s
puts str #=> "123"
```

You can also chain the `to_s` method directly on the integer:

```ruby
x = 456
puts x.to_s #=> "456"
```

And finally, you can even interpolate the integer directly into a string using string interpolation:

```ruby
x = 789
puts "The value of x is #{x.to_s}" #=> "The value of x is 789"
```

So you can see that there are many ways to convert an integer to a string in Ruby, and all of them utilize the `to_s` method as the primary mechanism for doing so.
