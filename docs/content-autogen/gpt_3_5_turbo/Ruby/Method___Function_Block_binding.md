In Ruby, block binding is used to create a new block-local variable that is accessible only within the block in which itâ€™s defined. This helps prevent the variable from unintentionally conflicting with similarly named variables in other parts of the code.

To use block binding in Ruby, you can use the `begin` and `end` keywords to define the block. Within this block, you can use the `|variable|` syntax to define the new block-local variable. Here's an example:

```ruby
def print_twice(array)
   array.each do |num|
      begin
         x = num * 2
         puts x
      end
   end
end
```

In this example, the `begin` and `end` keywords define a block, and the `|num|` syntax creates the block-local variable `num`. Within this block, we perform some calculations with `num` to double it, and then print it twice.

Another example using block binding in Ruby is:

```ruby
array = [1, 2, 3]

array.each do |i ; square|
  square = i * i
  puts square
end
```

In this example, the variable `square` is declared with `;` in the block parameter list, as a separated block-local variable. When the block is executed, each element in the array is multiplied by itself and each result is stored in the `square` variable. The `puts` method then prints out each value of `square`.

Overall, block binding helps you define variables within blocks that are unique to that block, which helps prevent conflicts and improve the readability of your code.
