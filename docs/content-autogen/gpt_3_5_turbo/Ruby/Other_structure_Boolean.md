In Ruby, a boolean is a value that can either be `true` or `false`. It is often used to evaluate conditions in programs. Here are some examples of how to use boolean in Ruby:

1. Checking for equality: You can use the double equals `==` operator to compare two values and return a boolean result. For example:

```
x = 5
y = 10
puts x == y # prints false
```

2. Comparing values: You can use comparison operators such as `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=` to compare two values and return a boolean result. For example:

```
x = 5
y = 10
puts x < y # prints true
```

3. Using logical operators: You can use logical operators such as `&&` (and), `||` (or), and `!` (not) to combine boolean expressions and return a boolean result. For example:

```
x = 5
y = 10
z = 15
puts x < y && y < z # prints true
```

4. Testing for truthiness: In Ruby, all objects can be evaluated as `true` or `false`, except for `nil` and `false` themselves. For example:

```
x = 5
puts x # prints true

y = nil
puts y # prints false
```

These are just a few examples of how to use boolean in Ruby. Booleans are a fundamental concept in programming and are used in many different ways in many different programming languages.
