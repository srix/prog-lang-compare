To create an array in Ruby, you can use square brackets [] and separate the elements with commas. Here are some examples:

1. An array of integers:
```
array_of_numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```

2. An array of strings:
```
array_of_colors = ["red", "green", "blue"]
```

3. An array of mixed data types:
```
mixed_array = [1, "hello", 2.5, true]
```

4. An empty array:
```
empty_array = []
```

You can also create an array using the Array.new method, like this:
```
new_array = Array.new(3, "hello")
```

This will create an array with 3 elements, all with the value "hello". You can replace "hello" with any value you want.
