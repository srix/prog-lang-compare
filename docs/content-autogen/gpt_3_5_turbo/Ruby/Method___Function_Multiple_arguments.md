In Ruby, you can define a method or function that takes multiple arguments to perform a specific task. You can pass any number of arguments to the method or function as long as their type is as expected by the method or function.

Here's an example of a method with two arguments:

```ruby
def add_numbers(num1, num2)
  puts num1 + num2
end

# Call the method by passing two arguments
add_numbers(5, 10)  # Output: 15
```

In the above example, the `add_numbers` method takes two arguments, `num1` and `num2`, and adds them together to return the value.

You can also define a method with more than two arguments, as shown below:

```ruby
def find_average(num1, num2, num3, num4, num5)
  sum = num1 + num2 + num3 + num4 + num5
  puts sum / 5.0
end

# Call the method by passing five arguments
find_average(2, 4, 6, 8, 10)  # Output: 6.0
```

In the above example, the `find_average` method takes five arguments, `num1` to `num5`, and calculates their average.

In addition to defining methods with multiple arguments, you can pass multiple arguments to an existing method as well:

```ruby
def multiply_numbers(*numbers)
  result = 1
  numbers.each { |n| result *= n }
  puts result
end

# Call the method by passing multiple arguments
multiply_numbers(2, 3, 4)  # Output: 24
multiply_numbers(5, 10, 20, 30)  # Output: 30000
```

In this example, the `multiply_numbers` method takes an arbitrary number of arguments by using the splat operator `*`. The `numbers` parameter is an array that contains all the arguments passed to the method. The method then multiplies all the numbers in the array.
