In Ruby, you can find the maximum and minimum of two numbers using the built-in methods `max` and `min`.

Here's how you can use the `max` method to find the maximum of two numbers:

```
a = 5
b = 10
max_num = a.max(b)
puts max_num   # output: 10
```

In this example, we assigned the values 5 and 10 to variables `a` and `b` respectively. Then we use the `max` method on `a` with `b` as its argument to find the maximum of both the numbers. The result is then assigned to `max_num` variable and finally printed using the `puts` method.

Similarly, you can use the `min` method to find the minimum of two numbers:

```
a = 5
b = 10
min_num = a.min(b)
puts min_num   # output: 5
```

In this example, we use the `min` method on `a` with `b` as its argument to find the minimum of both the numbers. The result is then assigned to `min_num` variable and finally printed using the `puts` method.
