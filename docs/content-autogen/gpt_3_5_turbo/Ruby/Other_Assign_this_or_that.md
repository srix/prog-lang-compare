In Ruby, the keywords `this` and `that` are not used to refer to specific objects or variables. However, you can assign values to variables using the assignment operator `=`.

For example, if you want to assign the value `5` to a variable named `num`, you can write:

```
num = 5
```

If you want to assign a string value to a variable named `name`, you can write:

```
name = "John Doe"
```

You can also assign the value of one variable to another variable using the assignment operator:

```
x = 10
y = x
```

In this case, the value of the variable `x` (which is `10`) is assigned to the variable `y`.

You can also assign the result of an expression or method to a variable. For example, if you want to assign the result of adding two numbers `x` and `y` to a variable called `sum`, you can write:

```
x = 15
y = 20
sum = x + y
```

In this case, the `sum` variable will be assigned the value of `35`.
