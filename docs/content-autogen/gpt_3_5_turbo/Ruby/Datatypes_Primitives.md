Sure, as an AI language model, I can help you with that.

In Ruby, there are several primitive data types. Here are some examples:

1. Integers: These represent whole numbers and can be positive, negative, or zero. 

Example: `50`, `-10`, `0`

2. Floats: These represent decimal numbers. 

Example: `3.14`, `-0.5`, `9.0`

3. Booleans: These represent true/false values. 

Example: `true`, `false`

4. Strings: These represent text. They can be surrounded by single quotes (`'`) or double quotes (`"`).

Example: `"hello"`, `'ruby'`, `"123"`

5. Symbols: These represent immutable values that are commonly used as keys in hashes.

Example: `:name`, `:age`, `:address`

Here is an example of a Ruby code that uses some of these primitive data types:

```ruby
age = 25         # integer
height = 5.11    # float
is_male = true   # boolean
name = "John"    # string
city = :Austin   # symbol
```

I hope that helps!
