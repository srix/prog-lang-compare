In Ruby, you can increment a number in several ways. One way is by using the increment operator `+=`. Here are some examples:

Example 1: Using `+=` operator

```
x = 5
x += 1
puts x # Output: 6
```

Example 2: Using `+=` with a floating-point number

```
y = 3.5
y += 2.5
puts y # Output: 6.0
```

Example 3: Incrementing by more than 1 using `+=`

```
z = 10
z += 3
puts z # Output: 13
```

Example 4: Alternatively, you can use the `succ` method to increment a number

```
a = 7
a = a.succ
puts a # Output: 8
```

These are just a few of the ways you can increment a number in Ruby. There are several other methods like `next`, `pred`, etc. that can be used depending on your requirements.
