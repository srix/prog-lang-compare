Float numbers, also known as floating-point numbers, in Ruby are used to represent decimal numbers. They are represented by adding a decimal point to a number or using scientific notation.

Here are some examples of using float numbers in Ruby:

```
# Declare a float variable
num1 = 3.14
puts num1 # Output: 3.14

# Add two float numbers
num2 = 2.5
sum = num1 + num2
puts sum # Output: 5.64

# Subtract two float numbers
diff = num1 - num2
puts diff # Output: 0.64

# Multiply two float numbers
product = num1 * num2
puts product # Output: 7.85

# Divide two float numbers
quotient = num1 / num2
puts quotient # Output: 1.256

# Use scientific notation
num3 = 1.23e-4
puts num3 # Output: 0.000123
```

In the above examples, we declare a float variable `num1` and assign it the value `3.14`. We then perform different arithmetic operations on `num1` along with another float variable `num2`. We also demonstrate using scientific notation to create a float number `num3`.
