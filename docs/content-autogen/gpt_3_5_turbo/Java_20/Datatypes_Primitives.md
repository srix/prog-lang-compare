In Java, primitive types are the most basic type of data that can be used to store simple values. There are eight primitive types in Java, which are:

1. byte - 8-bit signed integer data type.
Example: `byte age = 25;`

2. short - 16-bit signed integer data type.
Example: `short temperature = -10;`

3. int - 32-bit signed integer data type.
Example: `int number = 42;`

4. long - 64-bit signed integer data type.
Example: `long distance = 1000000L;`

5. float - 32-bit IEEE 754 floating point data type.
Example: `float price = 4.99f;`

6. double - 64-bit IEEE 754 floating point data type.
Example: `double pi = 3.14159265359;`

7. boolean - boolean data type represents two possible values: true and false.
Example: `boolean isRaining = true;`

8. char - 16-bit Unicode character data type.
Example: `char grade = 'A';`

In the example code, variables are declared and initialized with different primitive types. The variable names can be chosen freely, but they should be informative. Note that the `long` and `float` types require a suffix (`L` and `f`, respectively) to distinguish them from other types.
