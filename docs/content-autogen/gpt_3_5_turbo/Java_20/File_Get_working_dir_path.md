To get the current working directory path in Java 20, you can use the `System.getProperty("user.dir")` method call, which returns the system property named "user.dir". This property represents the current working directory as a string.

Here is an example code snippet that demonstrates how to obtain the current working directory path in Java 20:

```java
public class WorkingDirPathExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String workingDirPath = System.getProperty("user.dir");
        System.out.println("Current working directory: " + workingDirPath);
    }
}
```

When you run this program, the output will be the current working directory path as a string. For example, if you run this program from the command line with the `java` command, the output might look something like this:

```
Current working directory: /Users/username/Documents/workspace/myproject
```

Note that the working directory path might be different on different systems, and may also depend on how and where the Java program is executed.
