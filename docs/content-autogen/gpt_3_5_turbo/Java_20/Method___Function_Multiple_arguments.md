In Java, a method or function can have multiple arguments, which enables you to pass more than one value to the method. To use multiple arguments in a method or function, you need to specify the data type of each argument and separate them using commas. Here is an example that demonstrates how to use multiple arguments in a method:

```java
public static void printFullName(String firstName, String lastName) {
    System.out.println(firstName + " " + lastName);
}

public static void main(String[] args) {
    String first = "John";
    String last = "Doe";
    printFullName(first, last);
}
```

In the above example, the `printFullName()` method takes two arguments of type `String` named `firstName` and `lastName`. This method concatenates the first name and last name and prints the full name to the console. In the `main()` method, we define two string variables named `first` and `last` and pass them as arguments to the `printFullName()` method.

You can also use different data types for multiple arguments, such as `int`, `double`, `boolean`, etc. Here is another example that demonstrates this:

```java
public static int sum(int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
}

public static void main(String[] args) {
    int x = 5;
    int y = 10;
    int result = sum(x, y);
    System.out.println("The sum of " + x + " and " + y + " is " + result);
}
```

In this example, the `sum()` method takes two integer arguments `a` and `b` and returns their sum. In the `main()` method, we define two integer variables named `x` and `y` with values of `5` and `10`, respectively. We then call the `sum()` method with these variables as arguments and store the result in the variable `result`. Finally, we print the result to the console using a `println()` method with a concatenated string.
