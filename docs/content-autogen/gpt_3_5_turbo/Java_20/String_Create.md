To create a string in Java, you can simply write a series of characters inside two double quotes. Here are a few examples:

1. Creating a string variable with a value:

```
String myString = "Hello, world!";
```

2. Concatenating two strings:

```
String firstName = "John";
String lastName = "Doe";
String fullName = firstName + " " + lastName;
```

3. Converting other data types to strings:

```
int myInt = 42;
String myString = Integer.toString(myInt);
```

4. Using escape characters to include special characters:

```
String myString = "I want to buy a new \"smartphone\".";
```

5. Creating a string array:

```
String[] myArray = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"};
```
