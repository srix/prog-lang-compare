Sure, I'd be happy to help you with that!

In Java, you can add an element to an array by assigning a value to one of its indexes. Here's an example code snippet:

```
// Create an integer array with a length of 20
int[] numbers = new int[20];

// Add an element at index 0
numbers[0] = 42;

// Add an element at index 1
numbers[1] = 33;

// Add an element at index 2
numbers[2] = 15;

// Add an element at index 3
numbers[3] = 77;

// Print out the entire array
System.out.println(Arrays.toString(numbers));
```

In this example, we create an integer array called `numbers` with a length of 20. Then, we add elements to the array by assigning values to specific indexes. We add the values `42`, `33`, `15`, and `77` to indexes 0, 1, 2, and 3 respectively. Finally, we use the `Arrays.toString()` method to print out the entire array.

I hope that helps! Let me know if you have any questions.
