In Java, "not" can be implemented using the ! operator. The ! operator is a unary operator that negates the value of a boolean expression. 

Here are some examples of how to use not in Java 20:

1) Simple NOT operation: 
```java
boolean a = true;
boolean b = !a;
// b will be false
```

2) Using NOT to check equality: 
```java
int x = 5;
if(!(x == 10)){
    System.out.println("x is not equal to 10");
}
// output: x is not equal to 10
```

3) Combining NOT with other operators:
```java
int age = 18;
boolean isCitizen = true;
if(!(age >= 18 && isCitizen)){
    System.out.println("You are not eligible to vote");
}
// output: You are not eligible to vote
```

4) Using NOT with conditional operator:
```java
int num = 11;
String result = (num % 2 == 0) ? "even" : "odd";
String notResult = !(num % 2 == 0) ? "even" : "odd";
System.out.println("Result: " + result);
System.out.println("Not Result: " + notResult);
// output: Result: odd
// Not Result: even
```
