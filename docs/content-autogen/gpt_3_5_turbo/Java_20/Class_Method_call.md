Of course! Here's an explanation of how to call a method in a Java class:

A method is a block of code that performs a specific task and can be called from anywhere in a Java class. In order to call a method, you'll need to know its name and any parameters it takes.

Here's an example of a method called "calculateSum", which takes two integer parameters and returns their sum:

```
public class MyClass {

  public int calculateSum(int num1, int num2) {
    return num1 + num2;
  }

}
```

To call this method, you first need to create an instance of the class, like this:

```
MyClass myObject = new MyClass();
```

Then you can call the method on the instance using the dot notation, passing in the required parameters:

```
int result = myObject.calculateSum(10, 5);
```

After this call, the variable result would contain the value 15, which is the sum of the two numbers passed in as parameters.

Note that you can also call a method without returning a value (using the keyword "void"), and some methods may not take any parameters at all. The basic syntax for calling methods is always the same, however: instanceName.methodName(parameter1, parameter2, ...);
