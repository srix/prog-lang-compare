To get the sister directory path in Java 20, you can use the `getParent()` method on the `File` class. This method returns the abstract pathname of the parent directory of the file or directory represented by the `File` object.

Here is an example code snippet to get the sister directory path in Java 20:

```
import java.io.File;

public class SisterDirectory {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Specify the path of the file for which you want to find the sister directory
        File file = new File("/path/to/your/file");

        // Get the parent directory of the file
        File parentDir = file.getParentFile();

        // Get all directories in the parent directory
        File[] subDirs = parentDir.listFiles(File::isDirectory);

        // Find the sister directory by excluding the directory with the same name as the file
        File sisterDir = null;
        for (File subDir : subDirs) {
            if (!subDir.getName().equals(file.getName())) {
                sisterDir = subDir;
                break;
            }
        }

        // Print the sister directory path
        if (sisterDir != null) {
            System.out.println("The sister directory path is: " + sisterDir.getAbsolutePath());
        } else {
            System.out.println("Sister directory not found");
        }
    }
}
```

In this example, we first specify the path of the file for which we want to find the sister directory. We then get the parent directory of the file using the `getParentFile()` method. We get all directories in the parent directory using the `listFiles()` method with a filter that only selects directories. We then find the sister directory by excluding the directory with the same name as the file. Finally, we print the sister directory path.
