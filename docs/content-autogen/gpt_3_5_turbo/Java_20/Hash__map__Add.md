In Java, the process of adding an element to a hash involves creating a new key-value pair and adding them to the hash. This can be done in a few simple steps.

Step 1: Initialize the HashMap

First, you need to initialize the HashMap, which is done by creating an object of the HashMap class. For example:

```
HashMap<String, String> map = new HashMap<>();
```

In this example, we have initialized a HashMap with keys and values as strings, but you can choose any data type you need.

Step 2: Add Elements to the HashMap

Once the HashMap is initialized, you can add elements to it by calling the put() method on the map object. The put() method takes in two parameters: the key and the value.

For example, let's say we want to add a new element "apple" with key "fruit" to our map, we can write:

```
map.put("fruit", "apple");
```

This adds "apple" as the value for key "fruit" in our HashMap.

Similarly, you can add more elements to the HashMap using the same put() method.

```
map.put("vegetable", "carrot");
map.put("color", "red");
```

Now, the HashMap `map` will have three key-value pairs: {"fruit"->"apple", "vegetable"->"carrot", "color"->"red"}

Overall, the code to add multiple elements to a HashMap would look like this:

``` 
HashMap<String, String> map = new HashMap<>;
map.put("fruit", "apple");
map.put("vegetable", "carrot");
map.put("color", "red");
``` 

I hope this helps!
