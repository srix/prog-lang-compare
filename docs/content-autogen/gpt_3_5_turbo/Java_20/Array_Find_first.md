To find the first element of an array in Java 20, you can use the index notation to access the element at the first position. In Java, the first position in an array is indexed as [0]. 

Here is an example code snippet to demonstrate how to find the first element of an array in Java:

```
public class ArrayExample {
   public static void main(String args[]) {
      // initialize the array
      int[] numbers = {2, 5, 7, 9, 11};

      // access the first element of the array
      int firstNumber = numbers[0];

      // print out the first element
      System.out.println("The first element of the array is: " + firstNumber);
   }
}
```

In this code, we first initialize an array "numbers" with 5 integer values. We then use the index notation to access the first element of the array, which is assigned to a new variable called "firstNumber". Finally, we print out the first element using System.out.println().

The output of this code will be:

```
The first element of the array is: 2
```

This demonstrates how to find the first element of an array in Java 20.
