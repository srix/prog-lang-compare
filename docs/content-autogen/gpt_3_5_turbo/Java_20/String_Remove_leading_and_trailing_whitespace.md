Sure, I can explain that.

In Java, you can use the `trim()` method of the `String` class to remove leading and trailing whitespaces from a string. Here's an example:

```java
String input = "   Hello, World!   ";
String trimmed = input.trim();
System.out.println(trimmed);
```

Output:
```
Hello, World!
```

In this example, we first declare a `String` variable `input` and assign it a string with leading and trailing whitespaces. We then use the `trim()` method to remove the leading and trailing whitespaces, and assign the result to another `String` variable called `trimmed`. Finally, we print out the `trimmed` string.

Note that the `trim()` method only removes whitespace characters from the beginning and end of a string. Any whitespace characters in the middle of the string are left intact. If you want to remove all whitespace characters from a string, you can use the `replaceAll()` method with a regular expression, like this:

```java
String input = "   Hello, World!   ";
String trimmed = input.replaceAll("\\s+", "");
System.out.println(trimmed);
```

Output:
```
Hello,World!
```

In this example, we use the `replaceAll()` method with the regular expression `\\s+`, which matches one or more whitespace characters. We replace all matches with an empty string to remove all whitespace characters from the string.
