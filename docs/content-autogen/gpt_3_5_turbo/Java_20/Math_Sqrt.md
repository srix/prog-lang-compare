To get the square root of a number in Java, you can use the `Math.sqrt` method.

Here's an example code:

```
public class SquareRootDemo {
   public static void main(String[] args) {
      double number = 20;
      double squareRoot = Math.sqrt(number);

      System.out.println("Square root of " + number + " is " + squareRoot);
   }
}
```

Output:
```
Square root of 20.0 is 4.472136
```

In the above code, `sqrt` method is used to find the square root of 20 and assigned to a variable `squareRoot`. The `println` method is used to output the result.
