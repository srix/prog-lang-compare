Mixins in Java are implemented using interfaces. An interface defining the mixin can be created, and then it can be implemented by other classes as needed. Here's an example:

1. First, define the mixin interface:

```
public interface Flyable {
  void fly();
}
```

2. Then, implement the interface in your classes:

```
public class Bird implements Flyable {
  public void fly() {
    System.out.println("Flying...");
  }
}

public class Plane implements Flyable {
  public void fly() {
    System.out.println("Flying...");
  }
}
```

3. Now you can use the Flyable interface to add fly behavior to other classes:

```
public class Superhero implements Flyable {
  private Flyable flyable = new Bird();
 
  public void fly() {
    flyable.fly();
  }
 
  public void setFlyBehavior(Flyable flyable) {
    this.flyable = flyable;
  }
}
```

In this example, the Superhero class implements the Flyable interface, and it has a flyable object that it delegates to for the actual flying behavior. It defaults to using a Bird for the fly behavior, but it can be changed at runtime by calling the setFlyBehavior method with a different Flyable object.

Mixins in Java are a powerful way to add behavior to classes without requiring them to inherit from a common base class. They are particularly useful when working with third-party libraries or APIs that don't provide the behavior you need out of the box.
