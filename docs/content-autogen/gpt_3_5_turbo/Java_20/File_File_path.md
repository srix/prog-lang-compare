To get the file path in Java 20, you can use the `java.nio.file.Path` class. Here's an example of how to get the file path using this class:

```java
import java.nio.file.Path;
import java.nio.file.Paths;

public class FilePathExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // File path for a sample file located in the root directory of the project
        Path filePath = Paths.get("samplefile.txt");

        // Print the file path
        System.out.println("File Path: " + filePath.toString());
    }
}
```

In the above example, we first import the `Path` and `Paths` classes from the `java.nio.file` package. Then, we create a new `Path` object using the `Paths.get()` method and passing in the file name or relative file path as a parameter. Finally, we print the file path using the `toString()` method of the `Path` class.

Alternatively, if you want to get the file path for a file located in a specific directory, you can specify the directory path as a parameter when calling the `Paths.get()` method:

```java
import java.nio.file.Path;
import java.nio.file.Paths;

public class FilePathExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // File path for a sample file located in a subdirectory of the project
        Path directoryPath = Paths.get("src/main/resources");
        Path filePath = directoryPath.resolve("samplefile.txt");

        // Print the file path
        System.out.println("File Path: " + filePath.toString());
    }
}
```

In this example, we first create a `Path` object for the directory path using the `Paths.get()` method and passing in the directory name as a parameter. Then, we create a new `Path` object for the file path by calling the `resolve()` method on the directory path object and passing in the file name as a parameter. Finally, we print the file path using the `toString()` method.
