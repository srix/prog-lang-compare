In Java, there are two ways to comment your code. 

1. Single-line comment: You can use double forward slashes (//) to comment a single line of code. Here is an example:

```
// This line of code adds two numbers and assigns the result to a variable
int sum = numOne + numTwo;
```

2. Multi-line comment: You can use forward slash with an asterisk (/*) to begin a comment block and the reverse (*/) at the end of the block to end it. Here is an example:

```
/*
This block of code adds two numbers and assigns the result to a variable.
It then prints out the result using the System.out.println() method.
*/
int sum = numOne + numTwo;
System.out.println("The sum is: " + sum);
```

Note that comments do not affect the execution of the code, but they help explain the code's logic and functionality to other programmers reading the code.
