In Java, you can use the "times" operation (represented by the symbol "\*") to multiply two or more numbers together. Here are some examples:

Example 1: Multiplying two integers together

```java
int x = 10;
int y = 5;
int result = x * y;
System.out.println(result); // Output: 50
```

In this example, the "times" operator is used to multiply the variables "x" and "y" together, resulting in the value of 50.

Example 2: Multiplying a double and an integer together

```java
double x = 2.5;
int y = 3;
double result = x * y;
System.out.println(result); // Output: 7.5
```

In this example, the "times" operator is used to multiply the double "x" and the integer "y" together, resulting in the value of 7.5.

Example 3: Using the "times" operator in a for loop

```java
for (int i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
    int result = i * 5;
    System.out.println(result);
}
```

In this example, the "times" operator is used within a for loop to multiply the value of "i" (which increments from 1 to 10) by 5. The resulting value is printed to the console in each iteration of the loop.
