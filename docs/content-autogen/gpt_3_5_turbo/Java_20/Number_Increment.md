Sure, as an AI language model, I'd be glad to help you learn how to increment a number in Java!

To increment a number in Java, you can use the increment operator (++). This operator adds 1 to the current value of a variable. You can use the operator either before or after the variable.

Here's an example of incrementing a number in Java:

```java
int num = 20;
num++; // incrementing "num" using the post-increment operator

System.out.println(num); // output will be 21
```

In the above example, we first declared a variable "num" and assigned it a value of 20. We then incremented "num" using the post-increment operator (++), which adds 1 to the current value of "num". Finally, we printed the value of "num" to the console using the println method.

You can also use the pre-increment operator (++num) to achieve the same result. Here's an example using the pre-increment operator:

```java
int num = 20;
++num; // incrementing "num" using the pre-increment operator

System.out.println(num); // output will be 21
```

In this example, we assigned a value to "num" and then used the pre-increment operator to increment it by 1 before printing. The output will still be 21, as before.
