In Julia, `unless` is a conditional statement that behaves similarly to `ifnot` statement. It executes the code only if the specified condition is false. The syntax of the `unless` statement is as follows:

```
unless <condition>
    <executable code>
end
```

Here, `<condition>` is a boolean expression, which when evaluated to false, the `<executable code>` gets executed.

Here's an example:

```
x = 10
unless x > 20
    println("The condition is false")
end
```
Here, the condition `x > 20` evaluates to false, and so the code inside the `unless` block gets executed and prints the message "The condition is false" to the console.

Another example:

```
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
unless "orange" in fruits
    println("Orange is not in the fruit basket.")
end
```
Here, the condition `"orange" in fruits` evaluates to false, and so the code inside the `unless` block gets executed and prints the message "Orange is not in the fruit basket." to the console.
