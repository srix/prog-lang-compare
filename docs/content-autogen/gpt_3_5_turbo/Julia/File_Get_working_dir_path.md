In Julia, to get the current working directory path, you can use the `pwd()` function. Here is an example:

```
# Get the current working directory path
current_path = pwd()

# Print the current working directory path
println("The current working directory is: $current_path")
```

This will output something like:

```
The current working directory is: /home/user/myproject
```

You can also use the `cd()` function to change the working directory to a different path. Here is an example:

```
# Change the working directory
cd("/home/user/myproject/other")

# Get the new current working directory path
new_path = pwd()

# Print the new current working directory path
println("The new current working directory is: $new_path")
```

This will output something like:

```
The new current working directory is: /home/user/myproject/other
```

Note that the `pwd()` function returns a string that represents the path to the current working directory and that you can pass a path to the `cd()` function to change the current working directory to a different path.
