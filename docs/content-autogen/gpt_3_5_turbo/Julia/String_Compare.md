In Julia, you can use the `==` operator to compare two strings for equality. To compare whether two strings are not equal, use the `!=` operator. Here are some examples:

```
string1 = "hello"
string2 = "world"

# Comparing for equality
if string1 == "hello"
    println("string1 is equal to 'hello'")
end

# Comparing for inequality
if string2 != "hi"
    println("string2 is not equal to 'hi'")
end
```

In the above examples, we compare `string1` with `"hello"` for equality using `==` operator and `string2` with `"hi"` for inequality using `!=` operator. In both cases, the output will be printed since the conditions evaluate to `true`.
