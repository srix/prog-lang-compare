In Julia, you can increment a number using the `+=` operator. Here are some examples:

```
# Increment an integer by 1
x = 5
x += 1
println(x)   # Output: 6

# Increment a floating-point number by 0.1
y = 2.5
y += 0.1
println(y)   # Output: 2.6

# Increment a variable by the result of a computation
z = 10
z += 3 * z / 2
println(z)   # Output: 25
```

In each example, the `+=` operator increases the value of the variable on the left-hand side by the value on the right-hand side.
