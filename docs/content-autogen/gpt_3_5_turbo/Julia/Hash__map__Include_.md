In Julia, you can check if a hash includes a key by using the `in` keyword or the `haskey()` function. 

Here's an example of using the `in` keyword to check if a key exists in a hash:

```julia
myhash = Dict("a" => 1, "b" => 2, "c" => 3)

if "a" in keys(myhash)
    println("Key 'a' exists in myhash")
else
    println("Key 'a' does not exist in myhash")
end
```

Output:
```
Key 'a' exists in myhash
```

Here's another example using the `haskey()` function:

```julia
myhash = Dict("a" => 1, "b" => 2, "c" => 3)

if haskey(myhash, "d")
    println("Key 'd' exists in myhash")
else
    println("Key 'd' does not exist in myhash")
end
```

Output:
```
Key 'd' does not exist in myhash
```

In both examples, we create a hash `myhash` with key-value pairs, and then we check if the key exists in the hash using `in` or `haskey()`. If the key exists, we print a message stating that the key exists in the hash, otherwise we print a message stating that the key does not exist in the hash.
