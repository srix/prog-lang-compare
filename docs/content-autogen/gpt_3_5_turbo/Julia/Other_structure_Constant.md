In Julia, constants are defined with the `const` keyword. Constants are used for values that should not be changed throughout the program. Here is an example:

```
const pi = 3.14159
```

In this example, `pi` is declared as a constant with the value `3.14159`. Since `pi` is declared as a constant, its value cannot be changed throughout the program.

Here are a few more examples:

```
const message = "Hello, world!"   # string constant
const my_age = 30                # integer constant
const weight = 68.5             # float constant
```

In these examples, `message` is a constant string with the value "Hello, world!", `my_age` is a constant integer with the value 30, and `weight` is a constant float with the value 68.5.

Once a constant has been defined, its value cannot be changed. Attempting to do so will result in a compile-time error.
