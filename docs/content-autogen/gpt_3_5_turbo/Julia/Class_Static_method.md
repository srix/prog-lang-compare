Sure, I'd be happy to explain how to define a static method in Julia!

In Julia, a static method is a method that belongs to a type rather than an instance of that type. That means that you can call a static method without creating an object of the type it belongs to. Static methods are useful in a variety of scenarios, such as defining utility functions or setting up initial values for a type.

To define a static method in Julia, you can use the `@staticmethod` macro. Here's an example:

```julia
struct Circle
    radius::Float64
end

# Define a static method for the Circle type
struct Circle
    radius::Float64
end

struct CircleProperties
    π = 3.14
    @staticmethod diameter(c::Circle) = 2 * c.radius
    @staticmethod area(c::Circle) = π * c.radius^2
end

c = Circle(5.0)
    
# Call the static methods
println(CircleProperties.diameter(c))
println(CircleProperties.area(c))
```

In this example, we define a `Circle` struct and then create a separate `CircleProperties` struct to store the static methods related to `Circles`. We then define two `@staticmethod` functions for calculating the diameter and area of a `Circle`.

To call the static methods, we write the name of the struct that contains them (`CircleProperties`) followed by a dot (`.`) and the name of the method (`diameter` or `area`). We pass in a `Circle` object to each method as an argument.

I hope that helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.
