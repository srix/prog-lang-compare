Interpolation is the process of inserting a variable's value within a string. To perform string interpolation in Julia, the variable's name is enclosed in curly braces, `{}` inside the string. Here's an example:

```julia
name = "Alice"
age = 25
println("My name is $name and I'm $age years old.")
```

Output:
```
My name is Alice and I'm 25 years old.
```

In the above example, the variables `name` and `age` are interpolated into the string using the `$` symbol inside the string. 

Alternatively, you can also use the `$(expression)` syntax to interpolate complex expressions into the string. Here's an example:

```julia
radius = 10
println("The area of a circle with radius $radius is $(pi*radius^2).")
```

Output:
```
The area of a circle with radius 10 is 314.1592653589793.
```

Here, the expression `pi*radius^2` is evaluated and its result is interpolated into the string.
