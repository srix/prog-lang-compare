Sure, I'd be happy to help!

In Julia, you can convert an integer to a float by using the `float()` function. Here's an example:

```julia
julia> x = 5
5

julia> y = float(x)
5.0
```

In this example, we first create an integer variable `x` with a value of 5. We then use the `float()` function to convert `x` to a floating-point number and assign the result to a new variable `y`.

You can also use the `convert()` function to achieve the same conversion, like so:

```julia
julia> x = 5
5

julia> y = convert(Float64, x)
5.0
```

Here, we use `convert()` to convert `x` to a `Float64` (a specific type of floating-point number) and assign the result to `y`.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any more questions.
