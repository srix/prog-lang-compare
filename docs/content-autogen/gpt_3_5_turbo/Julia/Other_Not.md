In Julia, `not` is a logical unary operator that reverses the truth value of a given condition. It is represented by the symbol `!`. 

Here's an example:

```julia
x = true
y = false

println(!x)   # Output: false
println(!y)   # Output: true
```

In the example above, the `not` operator negates the truth values of the variables `x` and `y`. `!x` returns `false` because `x` is `true`, while `!y` returns `true` because `y` is `false`. 

The `not` operator can also be used in combination with other logical operators, such as `&` (logical AND) and `|` (logical OR).

```julia
a = true
b = false
c = true

println(!a & b)    # Output: false
println(!a | c)    # Output: false
```

In this example, we use the `&` (logical AND) and `|` (logical OR) operators along with the `not` operator. `!a & b` returns `false` because `a` is `true` and `b` is `false`, and `!a | c` returns `false` because `a` is `true` and `c` is also `true`.
