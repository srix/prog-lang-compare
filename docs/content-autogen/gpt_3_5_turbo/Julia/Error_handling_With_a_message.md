In Julia, `try`, `catch`, and `finally` are used for handling errors and exceptions in code. 

The basic structure of try/catch/finally in Julia is as follows:

```julia
try
    # Some code that may produce an error
catch error_type
    # Code to handle the specified error type
finally
    # Code that will always be executed, regardless of an error being thrown or not
end
```

Here, `try` contains the code that may produce an error, `catch` will catch the error and specify what to do with it depending on the error type, and `finally` contains code that will always be executed, regardless of whether an error is thrown or not.

For example, suppose we want to divide two numbers and catch an error if the second number is zero. We can use the following try/catch/finally block:

```julia
num1 = 10
num2 = 0

try
    result = num1 / num2
catch DivisionError
    println("Cannot divide by zero!")
finally
    println("Division operation complete.")
end
```

In the above code, if `num2` is equal to zero, a `DivisionError` will be caught by the `catch` statement and the message "Cannot divide by zero!" will be printed. The `finally` block will always be executed and print "Division operation complete." 

Another example would be handling file input/output errors. For example:

```julia
try
    open("nonexistent_file.txt")
catch ex
    println("Error message: $ex")
finally
    println("File operation complete.")
end
```

In the above code, an attempt to open a nonexistent file will result in a `FileNotFoundException`, which will be caught by the `catch` statement and the error message will be printed. The `finally` block will always be executed and print "File operation complete."

Overall, the try/catch/finally structure in Julia is a powerful tool for handling errors in code and providing more robust programs.
