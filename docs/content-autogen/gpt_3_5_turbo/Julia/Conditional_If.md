In Julia, the `if` statement is used to create simple conditional statements that execute certain code depending on whether a condition is true or false. 

The basic syntax for an `if` statement is as follows:

```
if CONDITION
    # Code to be executed if CONDITION is true
end
```

Here's an example:
```
x = 5
if x > 0
    println("x is positive")
end
```
The output will be `x is positive` because the condition `x > 0` is true.

If you want to provide an alternative block of code to execute if the condition is false, you can add an `else` statement:

```
x = -2
if x > 0
    println("x is positive")
else
    println("x is not positive")
end
```

The output will be `x is not positive` because the condition `x > 0` is false.

If you have multiple conditions to check, you can use the `elseif` statement:

```
x = 0
if x > 0
    println("x is positive")
elseif x < 0
    println("x is negative")
else
    println("x is zero")
end
```

The output will be `x is zero` because `x` is not greater than or less than 0.
