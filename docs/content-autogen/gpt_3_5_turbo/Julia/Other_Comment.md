In Julia, we can add comments to our code using the hash symbol (#). Comments are ignored by Julia during runtime and are only intended for human readers to understand the code.

Here are some examples of how to comment in Julia:

1. Single-line comments

We can add a single-line comment using the hash symbol (#). Anything written to the right of the hash symbol is considered a comment.

```julia
# This is a single-line comment in Julia
println("Hello, World!") # This is another single-line comment
```

2. Multi-line comments

We can use triple quotes (""") to add multi-line comments in Julia. Anything written within the triple quotes is considered a comment.

```julia
"""
This is a multi-line comment in Julia
We can write multiple lines here
"""
println("Hello, World!")
```

3. Documenter-style comments

Julia also supports documenter-style comments, which are used for documenting functions and modules. These comments follow a specific format and are used to generate documentation automatically.

```julia
"""
This is a function documentation.

# Arguments
- `x::Int`: the input integer.

# Returns
- `x+1::Int`: the input integer plus one.
"""
function add_one(x::Int)
    return x + 1
end
```

In the example above, the comment includes information about the function arguments and return values.
