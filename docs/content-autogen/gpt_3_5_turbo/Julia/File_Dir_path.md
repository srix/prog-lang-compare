In Julia, you can get the directory path by using the `abspath()` function to get the absolute path of the file or directory, and then using the `dirname()` function to get the directory name from the absolute path.

Here's an example:

Suppose we have a file named "myfile.txt" located in the directory "myfolder". We want to get the path to the directory "myfolder".

```julia
# Import the dirname() and abspath() functions
using Base.Filesystem

# Get the absolute path of the file
file_path = abspath("myfolder/myfile.txt")

# Get the directory path by applying dirname() to the file path
dir_path = dirname(file_path)

# Print the directory path
println("Directory path: ", dir_path)
```

Output:
```
Directory path: /path/to/myfolder
```

Note that the `abspath()` function returns the absolute path, which includes the root directory ("/" in Unix-like systems). We can remove the root directory from the directory path by using the `joinpath()` function:

```julia
# Remove the root directory from the directory path
dir_path_no_root = joinpath(splitpath(dir_path)...)

# Print the directory path without the root directory
println("Directory path without root: ", dir_path_no_root)
```

Output:
```
Directory path without root: path/to/myfolder
```
