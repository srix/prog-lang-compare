In Julia, `and` and `or` are used as logical operators to combine and evaluate logical statements. `and` operator returns `true` only if both statements evaluate to `true`, while the `or` operator returns `true` if at least one of the statements evaluates to `true`.

Syntax:

```julia
# Using and operator
statement_1 && statement_2

# Using or operator
statement_1 || statement_2
```

Here are some examples:

```julia
# Using and operator
x = 5
y = 10
if x < y && y > 8
    println("Both statements are true")
end

# Output: Both statements are true

# Using or operator
x = 5
y = 10
if x < 3 || y > 8
    println("At least one statement is true")
end

# Output: At least one statement is true
```

You can also combine multiple `and` and `or` statements by using parentheses:

```julia
# Using and and or operators
x = 5
y = 10
if (x < y && y > 8) || x == 5
    println("At least one statement is true")
end

# Output: At least one statement is true
```
