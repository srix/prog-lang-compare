To get the file path in Julia, you can use the `pwd()` function, which returns the current working directory as a string. Here's an example:

```julia
julia> pwd()
"/Users/yourusername/foldername"
```

Alternatively, if you need to get the path of a specific file, you can use the `joinpath()` function, which concatenates the components of a file path using the appropriate path separator for your operating system. Here's an example:

```julia
julia> filepath = joinpath(pwd(), "my_file.txt")
"/Users/yourusername/foldername/my_file.txt"
```

In this example, `pwd()` returns the path to the current working directory, and we use `joinpath()` to append the filename "my_file.txt" to the end of the path. The resulting `filepath` variable contains the full path to the file, including the directory and filename.
