In Julia, you can compare numbers using comparison operators. Here are some examples:

1. Equal to: The `==` operator is used to check if two numbers are equal.

```julia
a = 5
b = 6
c = 5

println(a == b)   # Output: false
println(a == c)   # Output: true
```

2. Not equal to: The `!=` operator is used to check if two numbers are not equal.

```julia
a = 5
b = 6
c = 5

println(a != b)   # Output: true
println(a != c)   # Output: false
```

3. Greater than: The `>` operator is used to check if one number is greater than the other.

```julia
a = 5
b = 6

println(a > b)    # Output: false
println(b > a)    # Output: true
```

4. Less than: The `<` operator is used to check if one number is less than the other.

```julia
a = 5
b = 6

println(a < b)    # Output: true
println(b < a)    # Output: false
```

5. Greater than or equal to: The `>=` operator is used to check if one number is greater than or equal to the other.

```julia
a = 5
b = 6

println(a >= b)   # Output: false
println(b >= a)   # Output: true
println(a >= a)   # Output: true
```

6. Less than or equal to: The `<=` operator is used to check if one number is less than or equal to the other.

```julia
a = 5
b = 6

println(a <= b)   # Output: true
println(b <= a)   # Output: false
println(a <= a)   # Output: true
```

These operators can be used with any numerical data type in Julia, such as `Int`, `Float64`, or `BigInt`.
