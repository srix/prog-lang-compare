Sure, to run a command in Julia, you can simply open the Julia command line interface or the Julia integrated development environment (IDE) and start typing the command. Here are some examples:

1. Hello World: To print "Hello World" in Julia, type the following command in the Julia REPL:

```
println("Hello World")
```

2. Variable Assignment: To assign a variable, you can use the assignment operator `=`. For instance, the following code assigns the value 42 to a variable `x`:

```
x = 42
```

3. Mathematical Operations: You can use common math operators in Julia such as `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, and `%`. Here's an example that adds two numbers together:

```
sum = 5 + 3
```

4. For Loops: To repeat a block of code, you can use a for loop. Here's an example of a for loop that iterates over the numbers 1 to 5:

```
for i in 1:5
    println("The value of i is $i")
end
```

5. User Input: You can prompt the user for input by using the `readline` function. Here's an example that prompts the user to enter their name:

```
name = readline("What's your name? ")
println("Hello, $name!")
```
