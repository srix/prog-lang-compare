In Julia, the element of an array can be accessed by its index. The first element of an array can be accessed by using index 1.

Here's an example:

```julia
# Defining an array
arr = [5, 10, 15, 20]

# Accessing the first element of the array
first_element = arr[1]

# Printing the first element
println("The first element of the array is: ", first_element)
```

Output:
```
The first element of the array is: 5
```

In this example, we first define an array `arr` with values `[5, 10, 15, 20]`. We then access the first element of the array using its index `1` and store it in the variable `first_element`. Finally, we print the value of the `first_element` variable to the console.
