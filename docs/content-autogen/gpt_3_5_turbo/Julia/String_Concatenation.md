In Julia, you can concatenate or merge two or more strings by using the `*` operator. The `*` operator is used to join any two objects of the same type. Here's an example:

```julia
string1 = "Hello"
string2 = "World"
result = string1 * " " * string2
println(result)
```

This will output: `Hello World`

In the example above, the `*` operator is used to concatenate the two strings `string1` and `string2` along with a space character between them.

We can also use the string interpolation syntax `$(variable)` to join the strings. Here's an example:

```julia
string1 = "My name is "
name = "John"
result = "$(string1)$(name)"
println(result)
```

This will output: `My name is John`

In the example above, we have used the string interpolation syntax to join the `string1` and `name` variables. Note that we have enclosed the variables in `$()` to use the string interpolation syntax.
