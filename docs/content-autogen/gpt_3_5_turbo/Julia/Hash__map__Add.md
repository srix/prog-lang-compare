Adding an element to a hash in Julia is fairly simple. You could use the indexing notation to directly set the value of a new key in the hash, or you can use the `push!` function if you want to append a set of keys and values at once. Here are some examples to illustrate:

1. Setting the value for a new key in an existing hash:

```
my_hash = Dict("apple" => 4, "banana" => 6, "cherry" => 8)

# adding a new key-value pair
my_hash["orange"] = 5

# printing the updated hash
println(my_hash)
```

This will output:

```
Dict{String,Int64}("cherry"=>8,"orange"=>5,"banana"=>6,"apple"=>4)
```

2. Using `push!` to append a set of key-value pairs:

```
my_hash = Dict("apple" => 4, "banana" => 6)

# adding new key-value pairs using push!
push!(my_hash, "cherry" => 8, "orange" => 5)

# printing the updated hash
println(my_hash)
```

This will output:

```
Dict{String,Int64}("cherry"=>8,"banana"=>6,"orange"=>5,"apple"=>4)
```

In both cases, we see how we can add new key-value pairs to an existing hash. The only difference is in how we choose to add the new pairs: with indexing notation for single key-value pairs, or with `push!` for multiple key-value pairs.
