To write a file in Julia, you can use the `write()` or `writedlm()` function. 

Here's an example of using `write()` function:

```julia
filename = "example.txt"
content = "This is an example content to be written to a file in Julia."

# opening the file in "write" mode
file = open(filename, "w")

# writing the content to the file
write(file, content)

# closing the file
close(file)
```

In the above example, we first define the filename and content that we want to write to the file. Then we open the file in `"write"` mode using the `open()` function and assign it to the `file` variable. We write the content to the file using the `write()` function and then close the file using the `close()` function.

Another example using `writedlm()` function:

```julia
filename = "example.csv"
content = [1 2 3; 4 5 6; 7 8 9]

# opening the file in "write" mode
file = open(filename, "w")

# writing the content to the file with delimiter ","
writedlm(file, content, ',')

# closing the file
close(file)
```

In this example, we define the filename and content that we want to write to the file. We open the file in `"write"` mode using the `open()` function and assign it to the `file` variable. We write the content to the file using the `writedlm()` function with delimiter `,`. We then close the file using the `close()` function.

These are just a few examples of how to write a file in Julia. There are many more functions available in Julia for handling files.
