In Julia, `next` and `continue` are control flow statements that allow you to skip over certain iterations of a loop.

`continue`: This statement allows you to skip the current iteration of a loop and move on to the next iteration. Here's an example:

```
for i in 1:10
    if i % 2 == 0
        continue
    end
    println(i)
end

# Output:
# 1
# 3
# 5
# 7
# 9
```

In the example above, we are printing out the values from 1 to 10, but we only print the ones that are not divisible by 2. This is achieved using the `continue` statement, which skips over the even numbers and moves on to the next odd number.

`next`: This statement works similarly to `continue` in that it allows you to skip over certain iterations of a loop. However, where `continue` skips the current iteration, `next` allows you to skip any arbitrary iteration. Here's an example:

```
for i in 1:10
    if i == 5
        next
    end
    println(i)
end

# Output:
# 1
# 2
# 3
# 4
# 6
# 7
# 8
# 9
# 10
```

In this example, we are printing out the values from 1 to 10 again, but this time we skip over the value of 5 using the `next` statement.
